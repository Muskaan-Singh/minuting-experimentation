[PERSON14] OK, so let´s start.

So today is the deadline for, um, stop adding new content into the book.

So...

So do you have ev-

<laugh>

Everything there already?

[PERSON20] I do.

[PERSON14] I know that [PERSON20].

[PERSON6] Or me in a sense.

[PERSON20] Or in that same sense in, in that you have everything there even before?

<laugh>

[PERSON6] No, no, no.

I, now I, I, I get, got rid off the, like the to do sections at the end of the section so I can figure it all the papers that I want to refer to somewhere.

But maybe I would like to, um, write different stuff about them but well...

Yeah.

[PERSON14] But you still have like the many to does.

[PERSON6] No.

[PERSON14] No?

[PERSON6] Well, I have some to does but, but not the big to does.

So yeah, um, I´m OK that´s right.

[PERSON14] I, I, I can, I can share the screen.

[PERSON6] Hm, hm.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

Share my screen.

[PERSON20] For instant the multilinguality is not there at all.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

Um, yeah.

Multilinguality is missing.

Um...

Yeah and OK.

This one -

OK.

Um -

[PERSON14] So introduction is to do.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

Yeah.

So it´s kind of, yeah, not plannig to add new content, just write this nicely.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] The problem is that we haven´t that defined what does it mean to add new content.

[PERSON6] Like kind of the information is already there more or less so...

[PERSON21] <unintelligible> new contents.

<laugh>

Yeah, it depens on the definition.

That´s right.

<laugh>

Yeah, the multilinguality is not there.

Um, yeah, cause I don´t know much about it actually but I think we maybe (say) we can just -

[PERSON20] (We have) the paper about that.

[PERSON6] Yeah, we can just extract it from our paper kind of.

So...

So I guess the paper that cited there the [PERSON17] <unintelligible> for the multilinguality this is what we´ll kind of appear there and yeah.

<laugh>

That´s just the last one.

[PERSON14] That´s the last one.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] Hm.

Conclusions.

[PERSON6] Ah, conclusions are not optimal but -

[PERSON14] So the other, the other, um, sections are finished?

[PERSON6] Are there not finished but I would say the content is there.

<laugh>

[PERSON20] Oh.

The next phase should have been commenting on, on others text.

It doesn´t mean to comment on text that is not finished at all.

[PERSON6] Um, um, so the content is there.

So the text is not final.

It´s kind of, yeah.

So I´m not planning to add new content.

I´m just planning to rewrite what´s already there, um..

<laugh>

[PERSON14] So you didn´t understand what, what it is content.

<laugh>

Yeah, because -

Yeah, in the next week we should, we should -

[PERSON6] Like if you have -

[PERSON14] Have it and comment everything so...

[PERSON6] Yeah.

Like I don´t know if you have a box of chocolate and you just plan to arrange the chocolate nicely so you´re not adding new content, you´re just rearranging what´s already in the box.

So that´s my take of content.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] So -

<laugh>

So now we know what, what -

<laugh>

What are you think and you have still 13, 13 hours to -

<laugh>

[PERSON6] OK.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] To arrange the chocolate in the, in the box.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] Um, do you plan to add, um, some pictures there?

[PERSON6] Yeah, I don´t know.

I talked about it repeatedly that I´m not good at pictures.

I tried adding one picture and that´s about the way I can add pictures so just, um...

Extract them from some paper and, and put them there.

[PERSON14] Yeah, this is fai).

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] But so this is extracted from, from [PERSON26].

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] So I don´t know how, how many such paper we sh-, we, um, how many s-, um, these copied so <unintelligible> pictures are there.

[PERSON6] So it´s kind of like if you OK with images like that I can put there images like that.

But I´m unable to create images.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

[PERSON6] So this is just a png extracted from the paper.

So I opened the paper in Inkscape and I degroup it and I saved just the image into the file and <unintelligible> png.

And I put it here.

So that´s like the best I can do I guess.

[PERSON14] Should-

Shouldn´t we ask the (alters) whether, whether we can include such image, their image -

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] Into our book?

[PERSON6] I don´t know.

Maybe we should at least check the licence of the paper.

[PERSON14] Yeah, if it is, if it is ACL paper or -

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] Something -

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] It should be OK.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] We cite, um...

[PERSON6] Hm.

Yeah.

I, I actually don´t know like we definitely need to cited and said that it´s from that work.

[PERSON20] Yes.

[PERSON6] And...

Yeah, I actually don´t know like to rules like, I think it depends on the licence of each of the papers.

So I think it <unintelligible> -

[PERSON20] <unintelligible>.

[PERSON6] That you cannot do it, hm -

<laugh>

If it´s not [PERSON12] then I don´t know.

If it´s some -

[PERSON20] You can -

[PERSON6] Created comments then you probably can do it.

[PERSON20] Um, if it´s from ACL antology it´s, it´s creative comments.

[PERSON6] OK.

This is archive but archive lists the licence probably somewhere.

[PERSON20] Yeah.

You need to specified the licence that´s OK.

[PERSON6] Um, where do I find it?

<laugh>

Hm.

(PERSON26), hm, hm.

Because I know that I need-, needed to specify -

[PERSON14] Yeah.

[PERSON6] The licence now but I don´t know where it appers -

[PERSON14] <unintelligible> specify but -

[PERSON6] Ah, licence.

Here.

Yeah, archive, non exclusive.

Yeah.

[PERSON20] That this is bad.

<laugh>

[PERSON6] So, so it doesn´t give me any -

[PERSON20] No.

[PERSON6] Any rights.

It´s just for archive.

So would need to find if it was published somewhere else.

Hm.

[PERSON14] We could -

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[PERSON6] Let´s open the pdf.

Hm, hm, hm, hm.

OK.

Yeah, it doesn´t same.

Hm, this is it.

OK.

Proceedings of something on ACL web.

And...

Yeah, it´s, it´s (nakl) so when is, when is (nakl) it should be OK you say.

[PERSON20] Yep.

[PERSON6] OK.

And should we, I don´t know, explain that somehow like that the licence allows that or I don´t know what the (nakl) licence is like.

If we have to include the licence or something like that.

[PERSON20] Hm.

I think it´s creative comments but...

But I think it, it wouldn´t hurt if we explicitly state it.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON20] Like even what page of the paper it is and, and, and under what lesson it is.

[PERSON6] Yeah, so I can easily cite the pa-, page.

This is what I learned recentely.

<laugh>

Yeah, it´s just (covereted) comments by so I only have to atribute the source.

Yeah.

So I can say that is page 4.

Or figure 2.

What´s better?

Page or figure number?

[PERSON24] Figure number.

What -

[PERSON14] Figure number is better.

[PERSON24] What, what year was the article published?

[PERSON6] Hm...

19.

[PERSON14] 19.

[PERSON24] OK, so then it´s creative comments atribution 4.0 international licence.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

So that just we need to have to cite the source.

And I don´t know if you have to list the licence.

[PERSON24] Hm, it´s -

[PERSON20] Well -

[PERSON24] It´s an atribution and no additional restrictions so...

[PERSON20] But I would, I would still mention the licence.

[PERSON14] OK, the thing is one -

How many such pictures you would like to have in our book?

Because I, I think it´s not good to have many of such copied pictures there.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] So I think major, major all the pictures -

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] Should be ours.

[PERSON6] Yeah, I don´t know.

[PERSON14] It is -

It´s -

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] It looks better.

[PERSON6] Hm, hm, hm.

[PERSON14] Um...

Because in my, in my, in my chapture I (like) the matter the, all the, of the figures will be, will be ours.

Or I can generate some of pictures from maybe -

I, I plan to generate the picture from, from tabels which are in the, in the, in the papers so, so it looks better.

But I, I also plan the include one of two, one or two pictures from the, from the other papers.

Not much, not many.

Um, [PERSON6], here´s still, there are many subsections with no content.

<laugh>

[PERSON6] Um...

[PERSON14] These two?

[PERSON6] Yeah, that´s kind of, I don´t have more to say I think.

<laugh>

I can just -

[PERSON14] You don´t have any chocolate to, to this boxes.

[PERSON6] No.

I, I can, I can just say them more detailed since just kind of, um, um, um, nougats.

So they, they even no say much more in the original paper actually and I don´t know any other papers, um, on that.

[PERSON14] And these?

This is the same.

Then these <unintelligible> -

<laugh>

[PERSON6] Maybe there are two more papers about name entities.

I don´t think there are more papers about grammatical error correction or event fractuality.

[PERSON14] But it, it´s, it´s strange to the -

[PERSON24] You (two), you (two) deffinitely say more about event fractuality.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] OK, yeah.

<laugh>

[PERSON6] Yeah, that´s true.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] <unintelligible> fractuality, yeah.

<laugh>

[PERSON6] OK, fair enough.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] You at least <unintelligible> year.

<laugh>

[PERSON6] OK, that´s, that is correct.

<laugh>

Yeah.

So it shou-, yeah, I think it will be like one paragraph or something.

OK.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] Usually at the content at least.

<laugh>

[PERSON6] OK.

OK.

<laugh>

I agree.

<laugh>

[PERSON21] It isn´t easier to just put other like things?

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON21] It´s just <unintelligible>.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON21] I think -

[PERSON6] I didn´t really know -

[PERSON21] That people -

[PERSON6] How to -

[PERSON21] <unintelligible> like about the experiments.

[PERSON6] Yeah, yeah.

[PERSON21] In different tasks.

[PERSON6] Yeah, yeah.

I didn´t want to put through it just other but then it´s true that I don´t know where to prove it like these are syntax but, but the the other ones like gender of nouns -

[PERSON21] Hm.

[PERSON6] Of I don´t know semantics maybe but, um, I don´t know.

Um...

Yeah, I tried to group them just on (through) things like syntax or semantics but, um, often I actually did not very sure, um.

Like name entities.

I don´t know.

[PERSON14] Hm.

Yeah.

I, I have it much easier in the, in the attentions.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] Because I only need to group like some connections.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] So I group only the (presency) trees, constituency trees -

[PERSON6] Hm.

Hm.

[PERSON14] And, and, and coreferences.

[PERSON6] Hm.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[PERSON14] So...

[PERSON6] So, so here -

Yeah, in the, in the, in the hidden states or (contextual) embeddings people look for lot of stuff, um, yeah.

[PERSON14] Um, we still have the picture like the, (like) [PERSON24].

Where it is?

[PERSON21] Page 15 or 5?

[PERSON14] Um, it, it is -

Yeah, I don´t know why all, all my pictures are at the end of the chapture, there is some problem.

Yeah.

[PERSON21] This is it.

[PERSON14] This one.

That I think half of this -

<laugh>

Half of this figure is like for attentions and the other half is like for, for probing, isn´t it?

[PERSON21] No.

No, everything here is for attentions.

[PERSON14] Everything is for attentions?

[PERSON21] Like it´s hard <unintelligible> but some parts are probing but in transformers.

So yeah, it´s like, it´s like contextual embeddings.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON21] Yeah, so, so yeah.

This <unintelligible> it´s true.

[PERSON14] So maybe we should, we should devide this, this, um -

[PERSON6] Hm.

Into two pictures.

[PERSON14] Into two pictures.

[PERSON21] Yeah.

[PERSON14] Because this is <unintelligible>, this is, um, GPT?

[PERSON21] Yeah, this is like GPT -

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON21] GPT and attentions.

Um, there is also hidden one with [PROJECT2] -

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON21] So it would be also like probing.

[PERSON6] Ah, the hidden one we cannot see it now.

[PERSON21] Yeah, because -

[PERSON6] Oh, yeah.

[PERSON21] It´s on the right.

[PERSON6] Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

[PERSON14] There is on the right.

Yeah.

I don´t how chan-, how to change this.

This pgf but -

<laugh>

Look so far I haven´t look in, into it so...

[PERSON6] Hm, hm, hm, hm.

[PERSON21] Yeah, I, I think it can be some box that you can because to, to like put it some box -

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON21] Defined here.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

[PERSON21] Cause here, you can only put it´s on.

[PERSON14] It´s only included though.

[PERSON21] Yeah, they can like (part, part it) into -

[PERSON14] Yeah and there, there are also one problems if these element of, of -

<other_noise>

<unintelligible> pgf, I don´t know, yeah.

[PERSON20] Hm.

Well the problem is that, that, that (lighting) doesn´t want to, um, do the words through, through Overlap.

[PERSON14] Do the, for, for -

[PERSON20] So it -

Um...

Latex just, just for to prevents, the words from overlapping and then, then that´s why it does those stuff.

[PERSON14] Aha, aha.

OK.

So if it is not <unintelligible> nothing it will be OK.

Se we need to regenerate -

[PERSON6] Need to regenerate.

[PERSON14] We need to regenerate.

We need to -

Yeah.

[PERSON6] Smaller font <unintelligible> image.

[PERSON14] Smaller font.

Yeah.

And then transfer it.

Yeah, so...

[PERSON21] I can do it.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

Yeah.

Actually on-, only these two, two.

Only your, your -

<laugh>

Pictures are so fine pgf.

[PERSON21] Hm.

[PERSON14] The other some like pdf and I think so I, I (need) to, um...

Yeah, this is, this is, this is like, this is google docs.

<laugh>

It needs to be, to be -

Yeah.

To be done better.

But OK.

So in my, my chapture I, um, still don´t have the first part finished.

It needs to be rewritten.

But the chocolate is already in the box but I need to -

<laugh>

Rearrange the chocolates.

But it´s only the introduction and like the word element I think.

And then it should be, it should be more or less written.

So from 5.2...

Maybe is -

Yeah, missing -

Um, maybe I would, I, I -

Some, in some parts I would, I could write more but...

Yeah and there are some pictures missing.

[PERSON20] So if I want to read something I should start, um, what section?

5.2 and -

[PERSON14] 5.2.

[PERSON20] And go on.

[PERSON14] It´s -

Yeah.

Because 5.1 you, you already read it and I haven´t change it.

[PERSON20] OK.

[PERSON14] Um, so, so 5.2 and 5.3.

Yeah, the, the pictures will be, will be changed within so the-, they, they should be nicer but, um...

5.2, syntactic function, dependency trees, so yeah.

This will written by [PERSON24] and I, I have rewritten some, some parts so that it more fits the, the book.

Um, it´s (consequency) trees.

And yeah, maybe we will, we will remove this table, I don´t know.

[PERSON21] Hm.

[PERSON14] Um, um, yeah, and this is -

This I -

Yeah.

I have rewritten a bit the 5.3 but, um, is still, there is still missing the last, last part of this and some discussion o-, on this part so there is still missing something and the end of this sub-, subsection.

[PERSON20] Hm.

[PERSON14] And then -

Yeah, today morning I wrote or today night I, I wrote this conclusion but yeah, I don´t know.

So this is more or less written but yeah, some parts still need to be rewritten and, and the pictures may-, must be done better.

OK.

So, [PERSON24]?

[PERSON24] Hm, OK.

Can I share my screen?

[PERSON14] Yeah.

[PERSON24] Or do I have the pdf of -

[PERSON6] Switch it.

[PERSON24] Share my screen.

<unintelligible> entire screen.

OK.

Do you see my screen?

[PERSON14] Yes.

[PERSON24] Yes.

OK.

Do you see the book?

[PERSON14] Yeah.

<laugh>

[PERSON20] Yeah.

[PERSON24] OK.

Wait a minute.

Hm, I don´t -

Single page, hm.

OK.

So chapture 3, the first -

OK.

The first part is written I guess and I´m sure that it would, um, like I´m sure that, um, it would benefit from further reading and comments and rewritting and so on.

The to do section here can be safely deleted.

It´s just things that can be added but are not essential.

Then there is this 3.1 methods for interpreting neural networks and I thought [PERSON14] said he would write something.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

Yeah, I said it but I haven´t written.

[PERSON24] Hm.

And yeah, then there´s this 3.2 which I´m not sure if it belongs here or what to do with it but I think we can decide that at the end.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] I think this was, yeah, [PERSON6]´s, [PERSON6]´s, this was [PERSON6]´s thing.

So...

[PERSON20] This is what [PERSON6] moved into my chapture and then I moved, moved it here.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] Yeah.

I, I promised that I will, I will, I would, I will move fast of my introduction of my chapture to here as well because these, these are, these two texts are very, very similar.

[PERSON24] OK.

Well, I´m not sure how -

[PERSON14] So <unintelligible> in, in our plan, um, it is...

Um, where it is?

[PERSON24] Where is our plan?

Here?

This plan?

[PERSON6] No, the -

[PERSON14] Yeah, yeah, this one.

Yeah.

[PERSON6] Hm. [PERSON14] Um, yeah, this is 3.1.

[PERSON24] Yeah.

[PERSON14] [PERSON6] and me.

Rewrite and move there something from, from chapture 5.

[PERSON24] OK and then there´s this chapture which I need to move this.

That´s also in the to do list.

4.1, 4.2, move.

And then...

Yeah, I finally managed to train FastText embeddings.

And as you can see the bands are actually there.

Now what -

Now what´s strange the FastText image here seems much more, um, similar to the original Glove image here.

It´s much more similar than the Glove that I trained.

And Word2vec is still just noise so I´m not sure what make of this.

[PERSON20] Well, isn, isn´t it just because of the colours?

Of the colour scale?

[PERSON24] No.

This is the same colour scheme.

[PERSON20] OK.

Yeah, but I mean -

[PERSON24] These -

This, this is different.

[PERSON20] Yeah, but -

[PERSON24] You can see the, the bands here and the bands here in the FastText´s image are similar.

[PERSON20] But, but my point is that if you, if you would try to like shift the mean of the Glove colour scale you might end up with the same image as, as they, as they had.

They just tried optimized through the, they might it, might it optimised virtual so it´s more visible.

[PERSON6] So, so basic <unintelligible> numbers should be normalized a bit.

[PERSON24] Well, I´m not sure what do you mean because -

[PERSON6] <unintelligible>.

Like they don´t probably have the same, um, like the same mean, um, in the different models.

So if you just divided them by the mean and all the images.

[PERSON24] Nothing happens, right.

[PERSON20] Nothing happens.

Yeah.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON24] Because the, the scale is automatically adjusted to, to show the whole range.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON24] So...

[PERSON20] Yeah, but, but it <unintelligible>.

What I´m saying they, they, they might have use something lumenier just to, just to (look) it more visible.

[PERSON6] Aha.

[PERSON24] I was thinking about that.

Well, I´ll look into it.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON24] But it´s strange that the FastText -

[PERSON20] Yeah, yeah.

[PERSON24] Shows this structure right away.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

My <unintelligible> was different.

I thought maybe some of the embeddings do have some extremes so if you include these extremess then most of it will be squashed.

So if you, if you like cut of the top and bottom, 5 % maybe it could be different.

[PERSON24] Yeah, that´s option.

[PERSON6] <unintelligible> on scale but -

[PERSON24] That´s what maybe happening in this Glove image but why isn´t the same thing happening here?

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON24] Or why is it happening here?

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON24] And...

I don´t know.

It´s strange.

[PERSON21] It´s possible for Czech, not for English.

[PERSON24] Yes.

Yes.

But FastText shows the structure and the others don´t.

Strange thing.

Anyway, images, images, images, bla, bla, bla.

Yeah.

<other_noise>

I´ve, um, written something about debiassing.

I wrote a conclusion.

So in the end the only things left for the to does is the, is -

<other_language>

And then 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 which I´m confident I can do today so...

Tonight the chocolates will be in the box.

<laugh>

And you can comment on them and then I rewrite the chocolates.

<laugh>

And the chapture will be done.

[PERSON20] Um, are you planning to do something about, about the figures?

[PERSON24] What?

[PERSON6] My figures or figures in general or [PERSON24]´s figures?

[PERSON20] [PERSON24]´s figures.

For instants 4.1.

[PERSON24] Yeah, 4.1.

I will either move it to your chapture or delete it.

[PERSON20] Um, right.

And tell me what, um, how does it -

Because I think it´s, this is the same as my figure, um...

Where is it, um, where is it?

Where is that?

Um, 1.9.

[PERSON24] Yeah, well...

1.9.

1.9.

1.2, 1.4, 1.9.

Yeah.

It´s probably almost the same thing.

I don´t know.

I...

One thing is that your figure is quite ugly.

<laugh>

[PERSON20] At the other one would, would totally different fonts and -

[PERSON24] Yeah.

[PERSON20] And then so it´ll be beautiful.

[PERSON24] That´s true.

Also these figures are not completely the same because the original [PERSON2] model had some, um, I´ll -

How do I get back to the -

Here.

Hm, hm, hm.

It has these lines.

What do you call them?

Dashed lines?

[PERSON20] Yeah.

[PERSON24] They are some connections directly between embeddings and the soft max layer.

[PERSON20] Um...

[PERSON24] But yeah, also I think this is -

[PERSON20] That´s (line) only say that, um, that you can find the, um, the probability value for word at depositions it´s...

It doesn´t mean any like computational connection.

[PERSON24] Hm.

[PERSON20] And because I thought it was confusing it´s not in my figure.

[PERSON24] OK.

<laugh>

OK.

So I think I will delete this figure.

Also I think this is a bitmap image so it should be deleted anyway.

Yeah.

I will delete this figure and I may do something with your figure so...

[PERSON20] OK.

[PERSON24] Because like...

What I don´t like here is for example this arrow here.

<laugh>

[PERSON20] OK.

Well, if I, if I make the, the subsign smaller it will, it will get fixed probably.

Because in my disertation it wasn´t like this.

[PERSON24] Yeah.

[PERSON20] With a different fonts.

[PERSON24] Also these arrows in general are ugly.

But yeah.

Other then that I don´t need the figure when this figure is here so I delete it.

[PERSON14] <unintelligible> my part write your text, um, like 4.2 or 4.3 and then you can, you can make this figure, um, better.

[PERSON24] Yeah.

Sure.

[PERSON20] By the way this is the very first image I, I made in tix and the code is really terrible.

<laugh>

Don´t, don´t get scared when you, when you open the source.

<laugh>

[PERSON24] I´ve seen.

I think I´ve seen worse.

And...

Also, yeah, hm...

Hm.

Hm.

I think -

OK.

I -

This is also ugly.

<laugh>

[PERSON20] You are ugly.

<laugh>

[PERSON24] Well, I´m but I´m not putting my face into the book.

<laugh>

Anyway, yeah, we can leave the ugly figures to the end.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] Please, first finish, finish the text.

[PERSON24] Yeah.

[PERSON14] And figures at least in, in some -

Yeah, at these they should be there but they, they might ugly or we, we need to know what is there, what is in the figure.

[PERSON24] Yeah.

[PERSON14] No if the figure is ugly or not and then -

[PERSON24] I, I guess -

[PERSON14] You can make the figures, improve the figures.

[PERSON24] Yeah, I think we can improve the figures after it´s been send to the reviewers right?

If we don´t change the content of the figures just how they look.

[PERSON14] Yeah, yeah.

I think, yeah.

It, it is possible to change it after.

So if it, if we have it in pdf and not it pgf, it´s no problem I think.

If only -

[PERSON24] Yeah.

[PERSON14] If only (the font) change and the, the, the picture will be same only the nicer and then I´m sure it´s OK.

So yeah.

So first, yeah, the text and <unintelligible> is there.

[PERSON24] Hm.

[PERSON14] They, then, then the -

[PERSON24] Sure.

Hm.

So yeah.

So yeah, the figure 4.1 will be deleted.

Any other questions about my figures?

[PERSON20] Hm, probably not.

[PERSON24] Do I have any other interesting figures?

Not really.

[PERSON20] Just, just avoid an other <unintelligible> font, that´s fine.

[PERSON14] You will have figures in the missing sections like PCA and ICA.

[PERSON24] Yeah, probably.

Yeah.

[PERSON20] And what about figure 4.6?

[PERSON24] 4.6?

<laugh>

[PERSON20] Which is a bit map?

[PERSON24] Yeah, well...

Yeah.

<laugh>

It is a bit map.

Yeah.

I think I maybe able to find the source and generate a tix file.

Although, um, I will be -

[PERSON14] <unintelligible> is this?

[PERSON24] Yes.

So I´m sure I can generate a tix file for this big cloud.

I will have to rewrite the cropping thing because that´s done on the bit map.

But yeah.

We can leave that after -

[PERSON14] <unintelligible> in the big cloud will be visible?

In the - [PERSON24] Well, it will be resible, visible as it is visible now.

Maybe it will be visible if it´s tix.

I mean if I -

[PERSON20] <unintelligible> forever to <unintelligible>.

[PERSON24] Like right now, um...

It´s, hm...

Like it´s almost readable now when it´s a bit map so if, if it was text it would be readable.

Yeah, I mean I can read it.

<laugh>

[PERSON20] Yeah.

[PERSON24] Even though it´s quite ugly at this solution so...

Yeah, but OK, I´ll, I´ll transform this from a bit map into proper text after everything else is done.

[PERSON20] And maybe before fixing my arrows.

<laugh>

[PERSON24] Hm, well...

<laugh>

I don´t know.

Like this is just one bit map.

Do you have a bunch of arrows everywhere.

[PERSON20] Um, and, and the same (wholes) for, for, for, 4.8 which is a bit map too as, as well.

[PERSON24] Yeah.

[PERSON20] And, and 4.9\. which will be English.

[PERSON24] OK.

And 4.9 and that´s not my figure.

Actually no.

This seems to be vector.

Hm.

Cool.

[PERSON20] Yeah, but at least you can replot it so it, so it has the same font as the book.

[PERSON24] Sorry, what?

[PERSON20] You can replot it so it has the same font as a book.

[PERSON24] Hm.

OK.

I think about that.

[PERSON20] And, and it´s truly easy in Inkscape.

You just, you just open it in Inkscape as a pdf and save it as a pdf with Latex text labels.

[PERSON24] Hm, OK.

I would have to install Inkscape for that.

I guess I that, can do that.

<laugh>

[PERSON20] It´s one (commented) a common line.

[PERSON24] Oh.

[PERSON20] And, and half of giga byte disk space.

[PERSON24] Yeah, that, um -

<other_noise>

Inkscape.

<other_noise>

Well, it says only 170 MB that, yeah.

[PERSON20] Hm.

<laugh>

[PERSON24] OK, I can do that.

After the text is written.

And finished.

[PERSON14] OK, so please, um...

When you finish your part made the lines in the, in the [PROJECT3] schůzky document, um, green.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] So that I know that you, you really have it, the chocolate is (reorder) in the box.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] And so the deadline is today.

<laugh>

Today midnight.

And yeah, if I don´t see the, the green lines and I don´t see that it is really done in the comment I will, I will, I don´t know.

<laugh>

Send you something.

<laugh>

Ugly pictures in the -

<laugh>

[PERSON21] <unintelligible>.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] So do you think you can make it to-, today or?

More or less?

[PERSON24] I think so.

I -

The only thing missing for me is add PCA and ICA which I can basically copy from other texts.

[PERSON14] Yeah, but then you need to reorder the chocolate.

[PERSON24] Yeah, sure.

But at least it will be there and then move, move 4.1, 4.2, that´s also like 0,5 hour at most and then write something about probing I guess.

Well, I think I ca-, I can manage to do that today.

[PERSON14] OK.

And then where it is finished.

Or whet it´s written somehow we should all of us, we should read it all of book and comment it what is missing where and yeah, where are the problems and other things.

I was, um, searching what were the reviewers of the other, um, of the previous [ORGANIZATION2] books.

[PERSON20] Hm.

[PERSON14] And I think that it is not as...

For example [PERSON16] the word of tokens (text and trees), the reviewers are [PERSON10], [PERSON22].

[PERSON20] Yeah.

[PERSON14] So this is the last book, um...

[PERSON27], Sentiment <unintelligible> in Czech.

So this is written in English at least.

<laugh>

The reviewers [PERSON10], [PERSON18].

So it´s really upside [LOCATION1].

Um...

[PERSON19], but it was disertation so there would be there his opponent <unintelligible>, [PERSON10].

[PERSON10] is everywhere.

With like university.

<laugh>

Then this <unintelligible> [PERSON25].

So yeah, so they have like the -

<other_noise>

(PERSON1), <unintelligible>.

OK, so these are two, like two, two reviewers (on) outside.

But, but, um, I think if we have like, like one <unintelligible> reviewer from, from [LOCATION1], it´s OK.

So like...

Can we -

But it, it -

I think it´s better if we have, when we have the book alm-, almost finished, we can, we can ask someone.

Or -

Do you mean I should, I should ask someone now?

[PERSON6] I think -

[PERSON20] Yeah.

[PERSON14] It would be at least abstract or I don´t know if I ask only, OK, we will have a book with <unintelligible> about -

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] 160 pages.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] And it´s about hidden in the layers.

<laugh>

[PERSON6] So do we have some kind of abstract at some -

[PERSON14] We have the preface.

Pre-

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] Which is nice.

But it´s not abstract.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] It´s like the questions.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON20] I was also thinking about the preface don´t we need like a real introduction that, that all the books have?

Like what exactly you will find in the book, um, how was it structured, how should you read the book...

[PERSON14] Yeah.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] Yeah, that, that´s missing.

Because we have, yeah, after preface we have a background but this is deeplearning.

[PERSON20] Yep.

[PERSON14] In the begginings of -

Yeah.

Yeah, so we definitely should have something like introduction.

So I will add it into our to do list.

And do we have, um, conclusion or sum-, summary of our book?

I think not yet?

Have you have something?

<other_noise>

[PERSON6] Yeah, <unintelligible> summary.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

[PERSON6] That´s the conclusion from my one you need to move.

[PERSON14] Yeah, I know, I know.

I, I just -

[PERSON6] Yeah, on it.

[PERSON14] Wha-, what would be the different between like the -

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

Cause we will have like 3, 3 conclusions.

[PERSON6] No.

[PERSON14] And then, then one sum-, summary.

[PERSON6] Alright.

We are.

Yeah.

[PERSON14] One of conclus-

[PERSON20] Um...

I´m not sure if it´s, if it´s the same?

I mean, um, you can have some conclusions that you draw from, from the book, from, from the research you, you need but the summary of, of the book is somethin else.

Book, books often have summaries.

And, and they have the summaries in multiple languages so...

Sometimes.

[PERSON14] Hm.

[PERSON6] Yeah, anyway would we put something different into a book conclusion and into a book summary?

[PERSON20] Boo-, book, book summary is, is more like, um, lon-, longer abstract usually.

[PERSON6] Aha.

[PERSON14] But the introduction would be also something like, like what, what is the -

[PERSON20] Hm.

[PERSON6] Yeah and I guess -

[PERSON14] Book about.

[PERSON6] The conclusion of the book would also be something like that.

<laugh>

I don´t know.

[PERSON14] Yeah, it´s as a, it´s like a paper.

[PERSON6] Hm. [PERSON14] First you write what are you going to present, then you present it and then you -

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] Write what, what you presented.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] But...

[PERSON20] [PERSON24] brought some books.

[PERSON6] What?

[PERSON20] That [PERSON24] brought some books to, to, to have a look how, how they are structured.

[PERSON14] Aha.

[PERSON20] And there are no rules, um, it, in the books series that we should have a summary and, and summary in Czech and something like that.

[PERSON6] Yeah, the series said that the summary is obligatory.

But I don´t think it says more about what should be in the summary or, or so.

Um...

Yeah, summary in English must be in every Czech book.

That´s the only rule it says.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] Aha.

[PERSON6] So we have an English book so there is no rule.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] So for example [PERSON16] has conclu-, concluding tokens and then summary.

So lets see what he has in this (?? according to).

<laugh>

What is there?

Um...

Now lots of tabels, figures...

Summary.

That was, seems something like abstract.

[PERSON6] Hm.

Yeah, so it´s like one page abstract.

Hm.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

And concluding tokens...

[PERSON6] That´s more like (future) <unintelligible> so...

[PERSON14] Hm.

<unintelligible> is inside.

OK.

<unintelligible> not introduction.

Introduction is not there.

But this is like related work is included.

OK.

So let´s -

We can write the summary which is so kind of abstract and -

[PERSON20] And if the book is too short we can the summary in Czech.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] Yeah, we can.

So how, how long is -

[PERSON24] And in German.

And in French.

[PERSON20] <unintelligible>, yeah.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

[PERSON24] And then we can -

[PERSON14] <unintelligible> to -

[PERSON24] We can have a transformer transform the summary into Hindo.

[PERSON14] And [PERSON16], [PERSON16]´s book is coh-, 158 so it´s almost the same size of the book.

<laugh>

[PERSON24] So are we gonna be like measuring books with -

<laugh>

With [PERSON16] or what?

<laugh>

[PERSON14] So it, yeah.

So it, I think it it maybe, yeah.

It, it is a book.

<laugh>

It is not like <unintelligible> or something.

[PERSON6] Hm.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] OK.

So anything else?

[PERSON24] Hm.

Who´s book in the series is the longest?

<laugh>

[PERSON14] I think longest would be the (light) lexikons.

[PERSON20] Or [PERSON27] might be a good candidate.

[PERSON14] No, no, no.

[PERSON5], [PERSON3], <unintelligible>, bla, bla, bla, 274.

<laugh>

[PERSON20] Hm.

[PERSON14] [PERSON4], 236.

[PERSON20] Hm.

[PERSON14] [PERSON7], 375.

[PERSON20] Wau.

[PERSON14] But this is <unintelligible> lexikon.

[PERSON20] OK.

[PERSON14] But other books like [PERSON16], 158, [PERSON19], 162.

Yeah, so wa-

So is there any book which is shorter than our?

So far?

<laugh>

No.

[PERSON8], 149.

But I think we, we´ll add some of the, some pictures and will be there.

[PERSON13], 119.

<laugh>

[PERSON21] <unintelligible>, 110.

[PERSON14] Yeah, [PERSON15], 110.

So it is, it is OK.

So we, we have to write it somehow and so it´s readable, readable and...

[PERSON24] wanted to do <unintelligible> for -

[PERSON6] Yeah, it´s, yeah.

[PERSON14] Yeah, they will do all the, all the erros.

[PERSON6] Yeah, they are undefined references not (reply) defined labels.

Some defined cit-, citations -

[PERSON14] Yeah, these are -

Yeah, many of these are probably main because I, I don´t care so far.

<laugh>

Cause first I want to write a text and then I will, then I will solve the -

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] All these errors.

[PERSON24] Well, it´s hard not to introduce new errors when I, when there is so much errors that I can see if I´m introducing new errors.

[PERSON6] Yeah, I agree.

[PERSON14] Hm.

Yeah, OK.

I, I will, I will, I will go through it and, and try to fix that is missing, missing things.

[PERSON6] Yeah, so there are some citations that are not in the Zotero format so they´re deffinitely will bee always missing.

[PERSON20] Hm.

[PERSON21] The thing is from my survey.

[PERSON6] Might be.

[PERSON21] So -

[PERSON14] But I think I rewritten them, all of them.

[PERSON6] <unintelligible> this is, this is for now.

[PERSON14] This is for now?

Aha.

[PERSON6] But it´s -

[PERSON14] Yeah, but this is, this is, yeah, this is in the table.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] I haven´t -

Yeah.

[PERSON6] Hm. [PERSON14] This is the, the citation (from) the table.

[PERSON6] Hm. [PERSON14] So I, I <unintelligible> that.

OK, so this is the table.

So I will, I will comment it althought.

Alright.

[PERSON6] OK.

Hm.

There is some missing citation which is also something.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] OK, so yeah.

So maybe we can, we can end this session and, and finish the writing.

[PERSON24] And so the next meeting is?

[PERSON14] Yeah, next meeting is, um...

The, um...

[PERSON6] In two weeks.

[PERSON14] In two weeks.

Monday.

13th July.

Like -

[PERSON24] OK and -

[PERSON14] Going to be before, before the [PROJECT1] meeting?

[PERSON24] After the [PROJECT1] meeting it seems.

[PERSON14] After?

[PERSON6] Um..

So yeah.

The <unintelligible> meeting is plan, planned 12:30 and currently [PROJECT3] is -

[PERSON14] Hm.

OK, so after.

After the meeting.

[PERSON6] Um...

[PERSON14] But -

[PERSON6] I don´t know.

Um, maybe it can be even before.

Um, if we want that.

[PERSON24] But when will we go to lunch if the meeting is before?

[PERSON6] OK, yeah.

[PERSON24] Like -

[PERSON6] So it should be after.

[PERSON14] Yeah, OK, it will be after in our office.

[PERSON6] Hm. [PERSON14] Because here <unintelligible> after.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON24] So it´s lunch, [PROJECT1] meeting, [PROJECT3] meeting and [ORGANIZATION2] beer.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

I think.

[PERSON20] So what´s time is the meeting?

[PERSON6] 2 p.m.

[PERSON14] 2 p.m.

[PERSON20] OK.

[PERSON6] Yeah, the document says that, um, it´s true.

[PERSON20] OK.

I thought you just change the time because of the lunch.

So it´s still 2 p.m.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

[PERSON24] Yeah, it´s 2 p.m. so that we can go to lunch before the [PROJECT1] meeting.

[PERSON14] Yeah.

[PERSON20] OK.

[PERSON14] The [PROJECT1] meeting is 12:30 or?

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] Yeah, as usual.

OK, so I will be sending you many slack messages.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] If you haven´t written everything.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] And you would, you would need to read all the book and -

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] And we´ll see.

[PERSON6] Hm, hm, hm.

Yeah.

Yeah, I have holiday from Thursday but I think I will do some work even in the holiday.

[PERSON14] Yeah, I, I have holiday the next week.

So the whole the next week I probably will not do anything.

[PERSON20] Um -

[PERSON24] I also officialy have holiday next week but I will be working.

[PERSON20] Just an off topic question.

Do you plan to watch the ACL lectures?

During the next week?

Or what are your plans at [ORGANIZATION2]?

[PERSON6] Potentially, yeah.

Um, well, [PERSON20] -

[PERSON14] Yeah, we all -

[PERSON6] Suggested something on slack.

And basically -

[PERSON20] And no one apply?

[PERSON6] He didn´t investigate how this really works.

But my plan is that if he organised it something that I will join happily.

[PERSON20] OK.

[PERSON24] Yeah, me too.

[PERSON6] But I did, I didn´t check the ACL website.

I, I´m not registered for ACL anyway and I didn´t understand much like how it´s really works and I didn´t have time to investigate it so I´m just waiting so if somebody else like prepares it for me and says me, sit here and watch this and -

<laugh>

[PERSON20] There are, there are prerecorded presentations and a-, after there are broadcasted, there are live QA sessions.

[PERSON14] Hm.

[PERSON20] This is how the pre-, previous presentation looks like.

And there are, are tutorials on Sunday.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON14] So the presentation will be, presentation will be separated from the, um, question and answering sessions so -

[PERSON6] Hm.

So, so the presentations will be broadcasted like prerecorded and then the QA will be live.

[PERSON20] Yes.

[PERSON6] That make some sense.

<laugh>

[PERSON20] OK.

If you want to prevent like situations one, one, no one someone´s internet connection <unintelligible> presentation or something like that.

[PERSON6] Hm.

Yeah.

But the, um, but the presentations they will still be kind of live.

So they will be a broadcast.

So it won´t be like -

[PERSON20] Yes.

[PERSON6] You can watch it a day before or.

[PERSON20] No.

Though, though you need to watch it at, at the given time and <unintelligible> for each paper there are two time slots.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON20] So like people all over the world can watch it.

[PERSON24] Do you have to be registered for the tutorials?

[PERSON20] Pfff.

I don´t know.

I´m registered.

[PERSON24] And did you, did you have to like select tutorial?

[PERSON20] Yes.

[PERSON24] OK.

[PERSON20] Um, but you can, you can ask questions live on [ORGANIZATION1].

So perhaps all videos who are registered will get [ORGANIZATION1] link and will, will be able to ask questions and, and maybe the others can watch it as well, I don´t know.

[PERSON6] Hm.

[PERSON24] Hm, I´d like to watch the interpretability and analysis tutorial.

[PERSON20] Yeah, that´s -

[PERSON24] It´s with [PERSON9].

[PERSON20] Yeah.

[PERSON6] Aha.

[PERSON20] It´s some day (2 p.m.) if I have recall correctly.

[PERSON24] It says here 6 a.m. [LOCATION2] time.

I don´t know what that is.

[PERSON20] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

It is 3 p.m., 3 p.m. our time.

[PERSON6] OK.

I will be on the train at this time.

<laugh>

[PERSON21] Is it necessary to be here in person to watch it or?

[PERSON6] In defense we don´t know how to links work, yeah, so.

[PERSON21] <unintelligible>.

OK.

[PERSON6] I think it should work (badly) if you´re here and somebody else also wants to watch the same thing and he´s registered which I don´t know if, if it will be true.

<laugh>

[PERSON21] Yeah.

[PERSON6] I don´t know how many people are registered actually.

I know [PERSON20] is registered and [PERSON23] is registered and maybe [PERSON11] is registered.

And I don´t know if people can watch if they´re not registered.

Or unless they´re watching someone -

[PERSON14] Share the links.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON14] And the password or I don´t know.

[PERSON6] I don´t know.

I haven´t look into it.

So I don´t know how it works.

You know something more?

You´re registered so you don´t care and -

<laugh>

[PERSON20] Yeah.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

[PERSON21] <unintelligible> be this like screening here or other <unintelligible>.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

I think that´s kind of the plan but, um, yeah.

It definitely at least depends on what other people want to watch.

<laugh>

[PERSON14] Hm.

[PERSON6] So I don´t know how many paralel sessions there are but I <unintelligible> a lot again.

[PERSON20] So if, if, if, if [PERSON20] is there registered one and the <unintelligible> one on what sessions <unintelligible> all the time.

[PERSON6] It´s possible.

Like one of could registered as well.

But I don´t know how we would <unintelligible> for it.

[PERSON14] <unintelligible> because we, we need to pay for it and if we don´t have any, any paper there.

[PERSON6] Yeah.

<other_noise>

[PERSON14] So...

So anything else or we can, we can end this session and...

So see you.

[PERSON20] Alright.

[PERSON21] Bye.

[PERSON20] Have a nice day you.

[PERSON6] Bye, bye.
