(PERSON4) So I just realized that the, the, the speakers are -

The left speaker is to the right.

OK.

So -

<laugh>

(PERSON1) Is it a problem?

(PERSON4) Is, is not a problem, the, the, but only that the righ-, right (tester) speakers like, eh -

(PERSON7) Well, it's not a problem now but it we like want to screen a film or something -

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON7) It will be strange because the person will be walking across the street and the sound will go in the other direction.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

So, this is, this is that -

(PERSON7) Yeah.

<other_noise>

(PERSON4) <unintelligible>.

<laugh>

(PERSON7) Iím not sure it can be fixed maybe -

(PERSON1) So change it.

(PERSON4) I donít know how to change it but -

(PERSON1) Because <unintelligible>.

(PERSON4) So there are, there are -

(PERSON7) Yeah, you can fix it in the computer but really, they should fix the cabels here.

<other_noise>

(PERSON4) So we are recording.

(PERSON3) is, has a meeting <unintelligible> still probably.

Thatís right.

I haven't told you, I would like to arrange meeting, um, for the (start) project.

(PERSON1) Hm.

(PERSON4) So you two and [PERSON10] from [LOCATION4] probably and maybe [PERSON5] and me.

(PERSON1) Hm.

(PERSON4) And so I will <unintelligible> do the submission.

(PERSON1) It should be this week?

(PERSON4) Yes.

It should be this week and I think no matter whether from here or [LOCATION4] because we will anyway here <unintelligible>.

Um, the skype call, or ZOOM call.

Because I think [PERSON5], [PERSON5], I don't know whether we should meet in [LOCATION4] or you donít mind to go to [LOCATION4], [PERSON7]?

(PERSON7) I donít mind -

I donít mind.

(PERSON4) Yeah, but -

Yeah, I think we can -

Because this, this connection is very good so.

Yeah, only, only if mal- they, they have, maybe they donít have very, very good microphones in [LOCATION4].

It will be our problem that we will not <unintelligible> good.

(PERSON7) I donít know, but -

But on Thursday and Friday I officially have a vacation.

(PERSON4) Aha.

(PERSON7) And I have something planned for Thursday.

I could do it on Friday but -

(PERSON4) Yeah, I -

Yeah, it, it can be, it can be done on Monday or -

Because I, I told [PERSON8], [PERSON8] set a deadline for us, for this, for today.

<laugh>

That we should, we should know who will be the main, main -

(PERSON1) Hm.

(PERSON4) <?another_language?>

(PERSON6) Principal investigator.

(PERSON4) Yeah, the principal investigator of that grant, yeah.

<laugh>

(PERSON6) [PERSON3] is not yet here, right?

(PERSON4) Heís not yet.

<other_noise>

<?another_language?>

(PERSON6) Employment?

(PERSON4) Employment?

(PERSON6) <?another_language?>

(PERSON4) <?another_language?>

(PERSON6) Part-time employment?

<?another_language?>

(PERSON4) Fifty percent employment?

<laugh>

(PERSON7) Part-time employment.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) [PERSON7] wanted to know -

(PERSON7) Precisely.

(PERSON6) <?another_language?>

(PERSON3).

(PERSON4)

You can get the ticket for when, um -

Yeah.

Hi, [PERSON3].

OK.

So, letís start.

<?another_language?>

(PERSON3) Jo.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) OK.

So, whatís agenda for today.

Um, yeah, first I, I, I would like to thank [PERSON6], um, that he submitted the (camera diversion), [PROJECT3].

Um, then, um, I plan to write like official email to [PERSON9] that we want to, that we want to have a book, publish a book and, um -

In the instructions on the web is that we should, we should send him a table of content at least.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Or some version of our book.

So at least we should have a good-looking table of content.

<laugh>

So.

(PERSON6) Table of contents.

OK.

<laugh>

(PERSON7) Table of contents.

I will open it here.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) So the version on the web like the, have you pulled and make - the la-

(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Ten minutes ago, and then there are last-minute changes.

(PERSON4) Maybe I can share the (security) <unintelligible> with [PERSON3].

Um, share my screen.

<laugh>

<?another_language?>

Aha.

There it is now.

[PROJECT12] book.

OK.

Can you see it, [PERSON3]?

(PERSON3) Yes.

(PERSON4) OK.

So -

<other_noise>

OK, so background, deep learning.

I think the first, first chapter is OK.

So, will you pl-

Are you planning to change something?

Or this is definitive -

(PERSON3) I donít -

(PERSON4) More or less?

(PERSON3) Unless, unless you find something outrageably bad.

<laugh>

I will change anything.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

But I think it is, this is ready for [PERSON9] so that he can, he can start searching for reviewers or -

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) I think so.

This -

So, I donít know whether he, he want to search on his own or he want us to, he will want us to find someone.

I will see but I, I would like to at least send him this, this version.

Maybe only the table of contents or do -

Do you think we should send him the whole boo-?

(PERSON1) Are we <unintelligible>?

(PERSON4) It is -

(PERSON6) Itís not secret.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yes.

(PERSON6) At least he will have an idea like how quickly he has to find reviewers.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yes.

(Probably) he (can), yeah.

(PERSON6) We can -

I think we can send him the whole thing and just tell him how it's <unintelligible>.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

Yeah.

I, I can write it but it, the, the book is really not finished yet.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Notable models -

That and the others.

<other_noise>

Yeah, only maybe, maybe in, in chapter 6 we should, we should change some of the sections -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Like to the hidden states to put into previous section.

<laugh>

(PERSON6) Yeah.

(PERSON4) Put somewhere.

<laugh>

I also have some visualisation -

<?another_language?>

<laugh>

(PERSON7) The conclusion, conclusions.

(PERSON4) Yeah, conclusion, conclusions, and conclusion of six, chapter six, um -

(PERSON6) Yeah, itís just lorem ipsum.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) So, yeah, we still donít know whether to restructure it somewhere to have only one chapter -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Like conclusion as a chapter or conclusion as a section only.

(PERSON6) Only part or chapter?

(PERSON4) Yeah.

Itís part.

Yeah, conclusion is part.

(PERSON6) I think it can be a part.

But maybe ñ 

The parts have to contain chapters anyway.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

It -

they have to contained chapters.

(PERSON6) I donít know.

(PERSON4) Yeah but the, but it's like the main, minor, minor thing.

(PERSON6) Hm.

<other_noise>

(PERSON4) I think it should be clear from the, from the sections what, what is, what is there in the, in the, the book.

(PERSON3) And when exactly are we planning to, to send it to [PERSON9]?

(PERSON4) Sorry?

(PERSON3) Um, when are you sending it to [PERSON9]?

(PERSON4) Um, I donít know.

After we have it, um, we improve it.

So, in like, I donít know, in the next -, at the end of this week.

(PERSON3) Alright.

(PERSON4) So please, please bear in mind that I will send it or I, I will send you an email notification that I am sending it but please.

Um, improve your sections so that it - looks good.

Um, OK.

So, then we can, we can start discussing with, with [PERSON9] what, what, who will be the reviewers and who, and so on.

Um, yes.

Um, since we have only two weeks on to the deadline but itís not much.

I donít know whether we -

I would like to had the book more or less written on, at the end of June.

I know.

You d-

Do you have any holiday plans for, um, until the end of the June or?

(PERSON6) To the end of the June?

Not, not <unintelligible>.

Nothing, nothing, nothing serious.

(PERSON1) No.

(PERSON6) Maybe one day here or there, but.

Nothing yet.

(PERSON4) So I would like you to focus everybody to only on the book b-, because then, then in a, in July I suppose will be many holidays or I donít know.

At least I will be, I will not be here in the first and the third week of July.

(PERSON3) Hm.

About -

(PERSON4) Maybe we should, we should -

Sorry?

(PERSON3) By the way thereís a (callish), thereís a (callish) <unintelligible> calling deadline which is, which is on July the first.

Is anyone planning to submit anything to (calling)?

Not, not, not, not me probably but Iím just asking.

(PERSON6) I donít know.

(PERSON4) I donít plan to submit anything, I think.

Because I, I would like to submit the, the paper to [PROJECT11] and the paper we havenít - we sent to ACL.

But then we, um, withdraw it because the reviews were not, reviews were not very, very good and we havenít managed to resubmit it to any other conference so maybe.

But the, the results of that paper are not very, not very on much, not very good.

So, I think itís good paper for [PROJECT11] either.

So, I, I, I will rewrite the paper to [PROJECT11], to the deadline at the end of June.

(PERSON6) We don't have a Google calendar for [PROJECT12], right?

(PERSON4) We donít.

(PERSON6) Would be good to - put the, the holidays maybe somewhere so that we know who is when where.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) We should have it on the, on the Wiki.

(PERSON6) Ah, thatís right.

(PERSON4) So maybe at -

It's updated in the Wiki we will see.

(PERSON6) Yes.

(PERSON4) But for - so, um, for example who will be here the second, second week in the, in July?

(PERSON6) What do you mean by second week?

(PERSON4) Second week is, uh huh - wait.

(PERSON7) Sixth to twelfth., or thirteenth to nineteenth?

(PERSON4) I, I meant, I meant thirteenth to nineteenth.

Because I will be here, so just thirteenth to nineteenth.

(PERSON6) Thirteenth to nineteenth.

On sixteenth I should be - go away and be away for the rest of the week.

So, I should be here on the thirteenth and fourteenth.

At thirteenth should be [ORGANIZATION2] beer.

(PERSON4) Aha.

(PERSON7) So, so, actually, weíll only be here on the thirteenth.

<laugh>

(PERSON6) I donít.

(PERSON4) And the week after?

Twenty to twenty-six?

(PERSON6) Or [PERSON7], you plan to be here?

(PERSON7) I donít have any plans yet.

I plan to be here at least till the fifteenth for sure because then the, thatís the, the, the, the, the, the Black box deadline.

Right.

(PERSON4) Fifteenth August.

(PERSON7) Is it August?

Why is in -

not corrected here.

(PERSON4) I think itís Fifteen August.

Or <unintelligible>.

(PERSON6) I think most of the deadlines shifted and nobody corrected it.

(PERSON7) OK, like -

Yeah, somebody just like -

(PERSON6) Sometimes itís crossed out.

(PERSON7) Cross out (calling) and didnít write new date in -

<laugh>

And then thereís Black box in July.

So Black box is August?

(PERSON4) Black box is August.

(PERSON7) Anyway, doesnít really matter I plan to be here anyway but -

Yeah, thatís, thatís good because I want to send something and, and I havenít written anything yet and Iím writing the book so -

(PERSON4) Yeah, I suppose that we, we will send some, some of the papers to Black box because, yeah.

(PERSON7) OK.

So -

(PERSON4) If it is not accepted to [PROJECT4], [PROJECT4], I suppose that our paper with [PERSON7] we sent to Black box.

If it is not accepted to [PROJECT4].

(PERSON6) I will try to update the Black box deadlines.

(PERSON7) Iím looking there, OK.

(PERSON6) <unintelligible>.

(PERSON7) Anyway yeah.

I plan to be here in July -

(PERSON4) So -

(PERSON7) And probably like half of August.

Maybe all of it.

I donít know.

And Iím taking vacation this week from Thursday to Friday and next week on Wednesday.

(PERSON4) OK.

(PERSON7) Thatís it.

(PERSON4) OK.

So, we can, we can have a meeting on July thirteen, fourteenth.

Um, fifteenth.

Um, no.

(PERSON6) Thirteen, fourteen.

(PERSON4) Thirteen or fourteen.

Maybe thirteen because itís -

(PERSON6) <unintelligible> leaving already.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

So, before the ⁄VAL, [ORGANIZATION2] beer I would, I would -

(PERSON6) Yeah, so -

(PERSON4) Be the meeting.

(PERSON6) Thirteenth would be (perfect).

<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yeah, so letís have a meeting.

I will, I will write it -

I will copy it here in, in this -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Document "[PROJECT12] schuzky".

You can wri-

Yeah, because we donít have a calen-, set calendar yet, so -

(PERSON6) Hm.

And the standard time?

So, eleven or, or later?

(PERSON4) (At the) eleven or (it better be) -

(At time)?

Fourteen?

<laugh>

After lunch?

(PERSON6) Yeah.

For me, later is better.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) OK.

So, letís set it on fourteen.

(PERSON6) <unintelligible> you talking this thirteen.

(PERSON4) thirteenth, um -

(PERSON6) July.

(PERSON4) July.

(PERSON6) But do we have some meeting before that or?

(PERSON4) Yeah.

<laugh>

We will -

<laugh>

I suppose we will have.

<laugh>

I, I only -

I only -

I wanted to set meetings, um, the meeting in, in some time.

In the middle of, um, July.

Then we could have a meeting on, um -

Iíll be here the, like, the um, one to - the first, to fifth, um, no.

Itís June.

(PERSON3) And, and what, what about a regular meetings on Tuesdays?

(What about) the next, next Tuesday and, and Tuesday after it?

Are those cancelled or?

(PERSON4) I, I suppose no.

The next Tuesdays will, there will be the meetings.

I, I want to set the meeting, um, like the holiday meetings.

(PERSON6) Next two Tuesdays are fine.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

Next two Tuesdays there will be meetings.

(PERSON3) Alright.

At eleven, as usual?

(PERSON4) At eleven as usual.

Yeah.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON3) Alright.

(PERSON7) OK.

(PERSON6) And then, there will be -

So, the third, the next week of, of -

So, the first week of July there is no meeting or?

(PERSON4) Um, the first week, um, the second -

(PERSON6) The second?

(PERSON4) Um, the second -

(PERSON3) From sixth to tenth of July.

(PERSON4) Because -

(PERSON6) So thirtieth we do have a meeting.

(PERSON4) Thirtieth we will do have a meeting and the next week I am not here.

(PERSON6) Aha.

And then thirteenth <unintelligible>.

(PERSON4) And then thirteenth, yeah.

So, we will have, um, the meetings twenty-twenty-three and thirty -

(PERSON6) And then thirty.

(PERSON4) Thirty, and then thirty.

(PERSON6) Hm.

So, if it is a three, there is a meeting.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yeah.

<laugh>

(PERSON6) Not, but not, not on the third.

(PERSON4) Itís not on the third of July.

But other - all other threes are meetings.

So -

(PERSON6) And then we donít know yet.

(PERSON4) Iím not sure whether I'll be here -

Yeah, you are -

Yeah, you are going to <unintelligible>.

(PERSON1) <unintelligible> but yeah.

Then, then on thirteenth Iíll be back.

(PERSON6) Or you can always join like [PERSON3].

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON6) If you at least somewhere online.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yeah.

Because -

Yeah.

Because for example the first or the second, second week I am not -

(PERSON1) Yeah, but -

(PERSON4) I am not -

I will be offline to <unintelligible>.

(PERSON1) OK.

(PERSON4) So, so I think -

(PERSON1) OK.

Thirteenth.

Thirteenth.

<other_noise>

(PERSON4) OK.

So.

OK, so we should set on, set, set new plan.

So, I, I -

So, [PERSON3], you, you plan to submit a paper to calling.

So, you have some work, um, so -

(PERSON3) <unintelligible>.

Um, I, I thought I would submit something but, but, but probably not.

(PERSON4) OK.

So -

Yeah.

(PERSON6) So there is (calling) deadline but nobody submits anything.

<laugh>

(PERSON3) It seems like that.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

I donít have nothing so, I should, I could submit, so.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON3) Well, it, it, it doesnít, does not depend entirely on me but I think the results is that, that we have now wonít lead into something publishable in two weeks.

So, weíll probably not submitting anything.

(PERSON4) OK.

So, I suggest, um, we finish the writing and the end of the June.

<laugh>

Or we have written it in some good shape.

And -

And we will see.

And we will have the meeting in the middle of June then.

So, um -

(PERSON7) July.

(PERSON4) July, July.

July.

(PERSON3) I think we need to s-, or, or wh-, what, whatís actually the d-d-dead-, deadline for?

I think we need several deadlines.

One deadline for stopping adding new content, then second deadline for stopping adding comments to others' content and the third deadline for having all the comments at rest or deleted.

(PERSON4) So the first deadline the end of June would be stopping adding any contents, new contents.

(PERSON3) Alright.

Hm.

(PERSON4) Um, yeah, we, we can go then through the, through the, through the book and, and, um, everybody can say, what, what, what contents are still needed there.

Um, like new contents.

And that we should go through everything, everybody and, um, comment everything.

So, this can be, um, discussed in the, in the middle of the July.

And yeah, then we will s-, because, because. 

Yeah.

The official deadline for, for the book was the end of June but I think now that itís ñ 

Um, we will not make it so, um.

But I, I think that it can be postponed, um, like the, the -

All the outcomes of this grant can be post-, postponed from, from the end of December to the end of January.

So, we have one month more.

(PERSON3) Because of the corona crisis or?

(PERSON4) Not because of corona crisis but I, I can ask when I, when I sell the, um, the -

<?another_language?>

The final report.

Um, I can ask, um, to postpone like the, um, um, all the outcomes, all the, the, um, the check of out- our outcomes, um -

(PERSON3) Hm.

Alright.

(PERSON4) The end of January.

So, I donít know how long, um, will take, um, the, the reviews and all the, all the things which I planned for half of ye-, half of year.

Um, after the submission.

Maybe it will be faster, maybe not.

But, um, anyway, um, I would like to submit it like officially the end of July.

Because I donít know whether it can be postponed many more.

Maybe it can but I, I,I donít like to like postpone it much because anyway if we postpone it we will not write so -

(PERSON3) Sure.

(PERSON4) So the first deadline.

So, I can write it somewhere.

Um...

So, um, June, June thirty, stop -

(PERSON7) Um, actually it says here that we say I donít know whether we have to prove it somehow or whatever that we werenít able to -

(PERSON4) Yeah, I know.

Alright.

(PERSON7) Continue according to plan we could move it for six months but -

(PERSON4) Yeah.

This is, this is including the fin-, financing like including the money.

(PERSON6) So for some conferences that happen in the first half of 2021 we could still use the money from the project?

(PERSON4) Maybe it's possible.

But I donít know when -

(PERSON7) Yeah, we could definitely say that we were not able to attend conferences because they were cancelled.

(PERSON4) Yeah, we can say it.

But I donít know whether we can say we cannot, we couldnít write the book.

(PERSON6) Hm.

<laugh>

(Well) we couldnít have meetings essential.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yeah, but -

Yeah, but you know.

(PERSON6) I know.

I donít know how they -

<laugh>

I donít know how they assess that.

Yeah.

You can ask.

(PERSON4) I, I can ask.

(PERSON6) I we have leftover money so it would be away but -

(PERSON7) Then again it would be better not to ask too early because then we would postpone the deadlines and -

(PERSON6) Hm.

Yeah.

(PERSON7) Not do anything for six more months.

(PERSON6) Hm, hm.

(PERSON7) So maybe ask in August or something.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yeah, I will ask when it's really critical.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Um, but anyway thi-

Um, you can for, um ñ

You didnít, um, without the corona crisis than we could, we could postpone it like, um, to the 31st, um, 31st of January like.

So -

But with-, without the financing so all the finances must be spend, um, so we have to pay for the, we would have to pay for book, um, like this year.

But I donít know how to -

I will ask [PERSON13], he -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) She, she will, she will know it.

(PERSON7) Yeah, but if we ask for the Covid nineteen postpone then we could use the money.

(PERSON4) Yeah, we can use it later.

Yeah.

But I donít know - yeah.

But I -

(PERSON6) It makes sense to maybe like for the book we donít need to shift it really.

So, for the book we shouldn't ask for the extension but for the conferences it would make sense to, to use it for some conferences next year.

(PERSON4) Yeah, but anyway I think we will -

If we can, if we will spend somehow mon-, the money this, um, this year.

We will not need to like to postpone it.

The spending.

And if we have some new publication next year, I think we will get some money from other sources so.

(PERSON6) Hm.

Yeah.

(PERSON4) So yeah, I will, I will ask.

[PERSON13], [PERSON13], [PERSON13] told me that she will study it and she will -

(PERSON6) Um.

(PERSON4) Let me know.

(PERSON3) Who is [PERSON13], by the way?

(PERSON4) [PERSON13].

(PERSON3) Aha.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) Like the [ORGANIZATION1], [ORGANIZATION1] and GAUP lady.

<laugh>

For, for, in [ORGANIZATION2].

(PERSON3) Alright.

This is the lady that, that, that sits it, it [PERSON11]'s room and nobody know who she, who, who she is?

Oh.

<unintelligible> or, or a demon.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) And she is moving to [LOCATION2].

Or at least for a couple of days per week.

(PERSON6) Partial only.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) I think we will -

Yeah.

Um, what we have promised, all that papers there's promised we will, we should have at the end of the, the end of this, this year.

So, we will not have any problems with, um, with this.

Only thing is the book and, um, we have to spend all the money somehow.

But I think we will make it somehow.

OK, so the deadlines.

Um, June thirty - stop adding new contents and...

So, the, um, the next meeting would be July, oh, no, no, no - no, July thirteenth.

(PERSON3), what was the next step?

Stop adding -

(PERSON3) Um, stop a-, stop adding comments.

(PERSON4) Comments.

And do you think we, we will manage it in thr-, in thirteen days?

(PERSON3) Oh, why not?

(PERSON4) If we are on holidays?

(PERSON6) Hm.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) <unintelligible> comments or comment.

And <unintelligible>.

Thirtyfirst...

Book finished.

Thatís it.

OK.

So now maybe we can, we can go, um, um, each of us can say what was done the last week and what, what is plan to do the next, next week.

So, I, maybe I can start.

Um, I was working on, um, Iím still working on the attention, um, attention metrices and different patterns.

Um, [PERSON1] send me the, um, the visualisations of the [PROJECT2] metrices and types for the [PROJECT2] and I, I also know that if I, if -

Because I generated the, the metrices from the, um, um, [PROJECT9], um -

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) Machine translation and the, like the heat maps were, were very sharp but I know if someone else generates something very similar the heat maps are ñ

Donít need to be as sharp as, as, um, of neural setting.

So now I, Iím, I, I donít know whether to, hm.

Because it was some, it was some, um.

If I donít know what, in what it was but if you set something differently, some parameter of, um, of the neural machine translation training then the heat maps -

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) Are that very, very different.

So, what we observed with [PERSON6] in our balustrades paper, um, these were very, very sharp.

So, the balustrades are really very sharp but, um.

If, if, um, maybe the settings is, um, different, the, the balustrades are very, um, very, how to say it, not sharp.

<laugh>

(PERSON3) <unintelligible> because I think that, that, that was like an exact replication of the "Attention is all you need" paper.

And we, we even got almost the same blue score.

(PERSON4) Hm.

(PERSON3) And, and I think it was trained on the same, same data set as you used.

It was, it was English to German translation what you work with.

Wasnít it?

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON3) So.

(PERSON4) So you think itís -

Because what, what I, um, um, observed in [LOCATION1] but they didnít use, um, they use, um, like, um, [PROJECT6], I think.

(PERSON3) Yeah.

(PERSON4) And we, we was changing the parameters and finally we, we get the same, like the similar balustrades as, as, um, with [PROJECT9].

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) But I know that there are many other settings that theyíre completely different, different balustrade but not, not balustrades but they are really, um, um, the balustrades are not as, not as visible as in our settings there.

So, so, now I donít know because in my chapter I just, Iím comparing the, um, [PROJECT6], [PROJECT6] -

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) Visu-, um, [PROJECT6] heat maps and [PROJECT2] heat maps and I know that some [PROJECT6] heat maps are completely different from balustrades.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) So I, I, um, I donít know whether to, um, how to, how to write about it in a, in the text because I know that they are, um, very different.

Maybe I will -

(PERSON3) Yeah.

Iím, Iím not aware of, of any like major difference that, that might cause that.

(PERSON4) I, I, I, I know that it was one parameter I donít know, I donít know which one but it was like layer something, um, not layer normalization, not was, something similar but, um, yeah.

So, I, I donít know whether to, whether to only write OK.

We tested this thing of, um, neural machine translation and we tested bad and (beside the, beside) the outcomes or <unintelligible> try more param-, changing the parameters and see different heat maps and ñ 

Um, but it will be much more and more complicated how to, how to say something about that so.

(PERSON3) Well, you can just add a footnote commenting that, that, it, it might be an artifact of [PROJECT9] because, because one <unintelligible> the heat maps look slightly different.

So, I donít know.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON1) I think it mostly comes from like concentration of the distribution because in [PROJECT2], [PROJECT2] also something like balustrades so this like straight lines but still the distribution is not so focused -

(PERSON4) Itís not, not so focused, yeah.

Yeah.

(PERSON1) <unintelligible>.

(PERSON4) It was <unintelligible>.

It was.

Yeah.

There are also something like balustrades but as -

Yeah.

Not as -

(PERSON1) Also I think colors really negative <unintelligible> sometimes.

Yeah.

Cause I used like blue on white, u-, you <unintelligible> like bright -

<laugh>

On black then I see those -

(PERSON4) Yeah, but I -

(PERSON1) <unintelligible>.

(PERSON4) I have also the blue or white or something -

(PERSON1) OK.

(PERSON4) Or white.

It was, it was really different.

But yeah.

I, I will somehow -

So that way I, I spent a lot of time on that chapter and on that section and I still have not finish it.

<laugh>

Because -

Um, yeah.

So, um, OK.

So, that was what I, I was working at last week.

Only and -

Yeah, I would like to, um, so I, maybe I will, I will go through my chapter and go, um, say what is needed to be, to be -

What are the new content this, that are needed to be, um, added.

Um, right is, this is [PROJECT5], this is [PERSON6]ís [PROJECT5].

Oh, no, no, no.

(PERSON3) This is [PERSON6]ís [PROJECT5] copied in the, um, in the <unintelligible>.

(PERSON4) This is -

Yeah.

Conclusion.

Why there is no table of contents in this, um, viewer?

(PERSON6) I can download it and open it in something else.

(PERSON4) You can.

OK.

So, the first part of, um, section, um, of chapter five must be reviewed.

I have many, still many [PERSON3]ís comments there -

<laugh>

And it should be rewritten because, um, there are some things that are, that should not be there and maybe, yeah, should be, that should be changed.

Then, um, so it, these other things about, about the, the, like attentions, the cross-lingual attention, and the start of attentions.

Then I have, um, the section about self-attentions and -

So, this is the categorization, it is almost done.

Only, I would like to, I would like to add, um, add the figures and I'd like to add some, um, conclusions and some, um, tables about, about proportions on different attentions, um, att-, attentions patterns.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) Um, then I have a section about highly, um, about the written that attention heads that mainly the paper from, of [PERSON10] et al. and [PERSON12] et al.

So, this is almost finished.

Um, then there will be, um, syntactic specific functions in attention heads.

This will be written mainly by [PERSON1] and he already -

(PERSON1) Hm.

(PERSON4) Has something for his paper.

So, he, he will share it somehow.

Or he will share it, um, copy it to here.

And also, the inference of syntactic <unintelligible>.

(PERSON1) Hm, hm.

(PERSON4) And, and then there should be the section about the interpretability, um, whether it is really inter-, interpretable, or not, the attentions.

And this is almost -

Right, the contents are there almost but it must be rewritten and I donít know what, um, how much details to give there because I have some tables there but they maybe, maybe they are not needed. 

Maybe I will shorten it because there are many details about, about the s-, about the papers.

(PERSON3) Um, would say the less details the better.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) Sorry?

(PERSON3) The less details the better.

(PERSON4) You would say -

(PERSON3) Yeah.

If you, if you can concentrate the main message without, without the details that, thatís what we need.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

It is -

Yeah.

It really went better.

So.

Yeah.

I took it to, um, yeah.

There are many, many details at -

Yeah, maybe it, it, itís better -

Because anyway now the, now the, um, the book now is one hundred and thirty pages something.

And we still donít have anything, um, um -

<laugh>

We still donít have -

Not anything.

<laugh>

Everything, so.

So, I think itís better we donít write it like one hundred fifty-eight, right, itís OK for a book.

So and I donít know how much content is still missing for the other chapters but, um, I think for my chapter itís now twenty pages long and I think it will have maybe a bit more but not much.

OK, so letís, letís go to [PERSON7].

Yeah, [PERSON7], can you go?

Yeah.

(PERSON7) Iíve written a few paragraphs.

Itís the most Iíve written since I started, till this week.

So, I donít know, the last week rather.

And I think itís almost ready to be read.

But not quite.

<laugh>

Anyway -

(PERSON3) <?another_language?>

(PERSON7) And trying to write as much as possible without it necessarily making much sense -

<laugh>

Um, s-, so that I have something that somebody can comment, and we can work on it. 

Because otherwise I would be crafting perfect paragraphs, um, at the, no, at the parade of maybe one a week, maybe one in two weeks and thatís unusable. 

So, this is also unusable, but you can comment on it and we'll see you where that leads.

Anyway during working on this I, I came to the conclusion that this chapter really, the, the old idea of having a story is not really doable for me because I donít know that much of the history and I would have to spend another half a year reading things.

So, I think I would concentrate on visualisations of embeddings and comparing visualisations of different embeddings inside that because all the papers thereís always this interesting visualisation but then not, no other paper does the same thing.

For example, thereís the, there are the (bands) in the Glove, um, Glove vectors and they say that the same structure can, is, that can be seen in, in other similar vectors as well.

But I havenít seen it done for Word2vec, anything so -

Also, that can be like the one of the contributions of this book that I will -

(PERSON3) It shouldn't be too difficult.

(PERSON7) I didnít understand.

(PERSON3) That it shouldnít be too difficult to (re)do visualisations.

(PERSON7) Yeah.

It will not be difficult, and they will take up a lot of space so -

<laugh>

Um -

(PERSON3) Alright.

(PERSON7) So I think thatís a way to go.

And also, I donít think I will be writing very much about, um, the generative, the new generative language models because like they are based on sub-words and the embeddings are not interesting anymore.

And I havenít seen any papers concerned with embeddings in these models because itís more interesting to look into the attention heads and things like that.

So, I think if we are to speak about these models which I donít think we have to because they are so recent then we can just -

(PERSON4) Hm.

(PERSON7) Say that you know.

They came up while we were writing the book and, yeah, we can just ignore them, or you could put them in one your chapters possibly.

But I think Iíll just mention them and, and wonít really go into it.

So thatís, Iím the - the, the, the, the -

Thatís the overview of where my chapter is going, and I have a few questions about data, but I think it will be easier to ñ 

If I just write them on Slack and we will discuss it there because I have to run anyway.

(PERSON4) OK, so -

Yeah.

So, what, what content is missing or?

(PERSON7) What content is missing?

Well, I think I -

Up to component analysis itís almost there but, yeah, OK.

Maybe donít...

Four point three is more or less commentable.

Four point three, one and four point three, two still need some work.

Four point four, thatís m-, mostly copied from elsewhere and I need to go for it once again and then four point five will be just a note so it will disappear.

Then I want to write something on debiasing and the summary and thatís it.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON7) And I ment -

And then like lot of the visualisation that I want to do are missing and thatís why I want to talk about the data and what data should I do the visualisations on but I think it will be better to let that discussion to Slack.

OK.

(PERSON3) It, it, it seems to me that there is a quite a big overleap or, um, I forgot what, what, what, what is, was.

Um, with, with section two point one that I, that Iíve written.

That explains how Word2vec is trained but it should be fine, I guess.

(PERSON7) I, I, I will, I will look into that and possibly delete some of mine -

(PERSON3) Yeah.

(PERSON7) Chapter and just, um, you know cite your chapter.

(PERSON3) OK.

Um, by the way it it was chapter four.

Is anyone, does anyone feel responsible for chapter three?

(PERSON7) I do.

I will write it someday.

<laugh>

(PERSON3) Alright.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) So whatís there?

Um.

Hidden states.

(PERSON7) I mean if, if chapter three is, an interpretation.

Yeah.

(PERSON3) Yes.

(PERSON4) Yeah, itís -

(PERSON7) Yeah.

So, Iím planning to go through at least the first two, um, articles mentioned in the three, zero, one.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON7) And include whatís mentioned in three, zero, two and then rewrite it to, yeah, to make sense.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) You know how to, how to do zero, zero section?

(PERSON6) Yeah.

If you donít put section, you just put subsection then itís in the zero section.

(PERSON4) Aha.

Aha.

<laugh>

(PERSON7) Yeah, but -

(PERSON4) So I cannot make ze-, zero, three, zero, zero.

(PERSON7) These sections will not be there because theyíre just to-do lists.

(PERSON4) OK.

(PERSON3) Oh, you probably really can you if you set manually the section counter to minus one and, and then at the section it, it will probably get zero.

(PERSON4) OK.

<laugh>

Good to know.

<laugh>

(PERSON7) And then you can always you know, itís just Tex.

So, you can redefined the numbers and...

<laugh>

Or you can just write the macro that rewrites everyone to zero and, and...

<laugh>

(PERSON6) Then it will be fun to read.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) OK.

(PERSON7) Yeah.

Anyway, I have to run so...

(PERSON4) OK.

(PERSON7) Sorry about that and -

(PERSON4) So -

So [PERSON6]?

(PERSON6) Yeah, so I can, I can share my screen so that -

(PERSON4) Yeah, it will be better.

(PERSON6) Yeah.

(PERSON7) So -

(PERSON6) So if you, if you switch to [ORGANIZATION4], do you see now my screen?

Yeah, thanks.

OK.

Um, so, um, so I, Iím restruct-, restructured the section so now what should be definitely readable is like the structure.

<laugh>

So, the things that are there should stay where they are, already and I, I need to add more, um, things somewhere.

Um, so for the introduction, um -

(PERSON7) Bye.

(PERSON3) Um, [PERSON6], by the struc-

By the structure you mean, um, you mean the titles of the sections and subsections, alright?

(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Titles of sections and basically the things that are there mostly should stay there or be made shorter maybe or rewritten a bit but kind of the contents thatís there should be mostly there.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON6) And there is some things missing which are not there yet.

So, the -

(PERSON3) Alright.

(PERSON6) Introduction, I have to change the whole thing basically because itís just some left over stuff from the previous introduction which rely it on some stuff that we moved to other chapters, so it doesnít make much sense now.

Um -

<laugh>

Um, so I plan to change it but generally the introduction should say that, yeah. 

We have these hidden states and these contextual embeddings and theyíre kind of the same thing.

So, we will talk about them and, and whatís hidden in them.

And so, then, um, the main thing is the section six point two.

Um, so this should be kind of the main contents of the chapter should be this, this section.

Um, so the plan is that it should contain, um, it should be partitioned to, to several subsections mostly the ones that are there already, probably.

Um, so somewhere I just need to say that OK there are these different models, and some are better than other, and some capture more syntax than other and so on.

So, either at the beginning or at the end of the section.

(PERSON3) By the way "Who is better", is, is, is a very bad title of the section.

<laugh>

(PERSON6) Yeah, um, yeah.

Probably the title should be rewrittened.

So, um, but the contents - itís generally what should be there just written more nicely.

(PERSON3) Hm, hm.

(PERSON6) And then, I, it went to go over the individual linguistic abstractions and see how they are captured.

So, I should probably begin with morphology and right now there are some parts moved from other parts of the text so itís not very coherent, um -

<laugh>

But in general, this is what should be there and, um, there are some more works that are not there yet which I plan to add.

Um, but these ones they should probably there, um, in some form.

Yeah, as we said so now itís structured according to the individual papers, so this paper found this, this paper found that.

Um, this is something we want to change so I plan to, um, just say whatís true and then just say who found it.

So, so to kind of look at it the other way around.

But itís basically just reorganizing the information thatís already there.

Um.

And for syntax, I definitely need to add something more but there is already quite a lot of syntax, actually.

Um, how do I make it some reasonable size?

Um, so, um, yeah, itís a same thing so itís, itís, um, things from different parts of the chapter now moved together to one syntax section and -

Yeah, I think I'm missing still some of the key, um, papers that find syntax in there. 

And I had some, some to-do lists, um, later but, um, this is what I plan to.

Um, so I plan to add something more and I plan to kind of shorten actually the things that are here, um, and again restructure it.

So that is says what is there, not, not the structure of the papers.

<other_noise>

And then the rest i-, itís -

Yeah, Iím not really sure about the division here so I have a section which is now called "Semantics", um, and Iím really not absolutely sure which things belong into semantics.

Um, so I have some things there which I found, which I believe are semantics, but I would be happy to take some suggestions, like. 

OK, this is not really the semantics, this is something else, I donít know.

And itís possible that Iím still missing some papers which also look at some semantic stuff.

I donít know if I have the semantic roles there.

I think so, but I canít see it now.

Ah, yeah, yeah.

Something is there, maybe there is something missing as well.

(PERSON4) Did you write this or?

I, I see only word (senses) and -

(PERSON6) Yeah, this is the -

OK.

Um, yeah.

You have the [PERSON3]ís face there, so you donít see the -

(PERSON4) Aha.

(PERSON6) The - the, um, (caption) of the (section).

(PERSON4) OK, I donít know.

Sorry.

(PERSON6) Yeah, I scrolled down. So, this thing, yeah.

<laugh>

Um, so, um, I donít know for example there is, um, work on noun gender -

(PERSON3) Noun gender is probably lexical semantics.

Winogradís schemas are probably pragmatics or maybe event what linguists call discourse.

Iím not sure.

(PERSON6) But the paper I read talk about it as semantics, but I donít know.

(PERSON3) Yeah, but, but coreference resolution is, is part of the discourse theory in [LOCATION3].

(PERSON6) Hm.

Yeah, well the, the point was that to result the coreference in the Winograd test you really need and actually to understand the meaning of the words kind of -

(PERSON3) Yeah.

(PERSON6) So in this they said it text semantics even though the task itself is probably not semantic, um.

Yeah, I, Iím, I was thinking whether to really try to say which is semantics or whether to have multiple smaller subsections and just say coreference and -

(PERSON3) Yeah.

(PERSON4) I, I, I would say it's much better.

Like, at least -.

(PERSON6) Itís probably safer.

(PERSON4) Itís safer -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Because, yeah.

Somebody cannot like it.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Yeah, someone would say, oh, this is not semantics, this is something else.

(PERSON6) I think you know cause -

(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah.

Itís, itís, itís -

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON6) Yeah.

(PERSON4) Itís hard to <unintelligible>.

(PERSON6) Everyone is <unintelligible> but at least it's safer.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yeah, itís safer.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) I, I have a discussion with [PERSON1] whether part of speech (tags) are syntax or morphology.

(PERSON6) Oh.

(PERSON4) So itís -

<laugh>

<unintelligible>.

(PERSON6) Yeah.

So, so the same could be done for syntax but Iím just saying syntax but there is constituents in syntax, the, the labels, the structure.

Again dependencies whether it's the structure or the labels or just distances in the trees so I could split it into multiple smaller sections.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON6) Because now itís just one huge section anyway, so -

(PERSON4) Yeah.

I think -

Yeah.

It, it -

Because anyway that, that would be like three sections like only morphology -

(PERSON6) Hm, hm, hm.

(PERSON4) Syntax, semantics.

So, it, itís better, if, if you can, you -

(PERSON6) Yeah.

OK.

So then yeah.

So, I, Iíll re-split it, it (work).

(PERSON4) Any-, anyone know what are the, the smaller, the smaller sections so -

(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(PERSON4) I think it could be better for, for reading.

(PERSON6) Yeah.

(PERSON4) As well.

(PERSON6) So I now have some (break senses) and I forgot whatís the paperís (drew).

Oh, yeah, so, um, these policy must (works).

So, um, again now I would say, yeah.

But keep it as a separate subsection.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON6) Um, just itís (typic) problem.

And thatís all for the, the, um, the abstractions that people look for, kind of.

Um, or at least what I have covered now.

Maybe I'll find something else which will get its own subsection but, um. 

More or less this, this is what I think will be there and, um, then there a few more.

So, um, one is which is in which layers.

Um, um, I donít want <unintelligible>.

Um, so thatís, um, again a different view so that I don't know.

Morphology is usually the first layers and then syntax is the deep layer, deeper layers or and so on.

So, um, right now itís a, a lot of, um, paragraphs, small paragraphs moved from elsewhere, um, so I should get a bigger picture on that and put it here.

Um, then there is another thing, um, where they look at, um, to a which, um, the, the context section.

So, the question is whether it really, um, captures some abstractions or whether it only captures word identity plus context, um, which is an interesting question.

Um, and it seems, yeah, to some extent it's just the context but to some extent it does do some high-level abstractions really.

So, I found it interesting, so I think we should have a section on that.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON6) Um, it doesnít really fit to the linguistic abstractions, before so I moved it here now.

And then.

Yeah, then the last thing I really have is the effect of pre-training task.

This probably should be larger and now I have just one work and there is definitely more works that looked OK, you should re-training for language modelling usually.

But maybe something else for different usage so, um, I havenít read much about that so, um, um, but but I think it belongs -

I donít know, um, I think it belongs here because I mean like the effect on what the representations capture after that, um...

Yeah, um, so I think this should be like maybe two pages, now itís one paragraph.

(PERSON3) Hm.

([PERSON6]f) I donít know.

Um.

(PERSON1) I have some visuali-, visualisation but -

(PERSON6) Aha?

So um, yeah, so I think whenever you have something that fits into something here, feel free to put it there -

(PERSON1) Hm.

(PERSON6) Cause itís a mess anyway, so -

<laugh>

(PERSON1) Yeah.

(PERSON6) You wonít make it worse definitely and hopefully -

<laugh>

You will make it better.

And, um, then, yeah, there is some list of papers that I want to cover, and I have not covered yet, um, mostly.

Um, maybe I wonít cover all of them but, um, maybe some are missing.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON6) But, um, yeah.

(PERSON4) So all these sections will be cancelled?

You a-, all -

(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah.

This is just like to-do -

(PERSON4) So now o-, only like papers that.

(PERSON6) mention to-do list.

Yeah.

(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah, that fit some of the previous, um, sections.

(PERSON6) Yeah.

Yeah.

And something we found still missing is multilinguality.

Um, I think we talked about it last time.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON6) Um, it ñ

We want to cover itís somehow, somewhere and I really havenít written anything about it and I donít even know if it should fit into this chapter or if it should be a separate chapter and I donít know what we actually want to write about it.

So, we only know this from [PERSON3] that we want to put the, um, the multilinguality paper that we submitted to -

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON6) Where did we submit it?

I donít know.

Itís -

(PERSON3) The [PROJECT4].

(PERSON4) [PROJECT4].

(PERSON6) Yeah.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON6) Yeah.

So, so we want to report on it somewhere.

<laugh>

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON6) So, I donít have actually any specific plans on that.

(PERSON4) You, we would like to report also that the, some information from the [PROJECT3] paper you submitted.

(PERSON6) Um, um, from this one.

Um.

Maybe, um.

(PERSON4) But definitely that you <unintelligible>, yeah.

(PERSON6) Hm.

Hm.

(PERSON4) It should be there.

(PERSON6) So, um, so I donít know if, if anybody, um, wants to take over this section, I, I would be glad but.

<laugh>

I donít know if [PERSON3] can do this or?

(PERSON3) Hm...

Probably not, I donít know.

<laugh>

(PERSON6) I donít even know if we want to put it into this chapter cause, um, in some way -

(PERSON3) I think we -

I think we do because itís about, itís about the hidden states of multilingual [PROJECT2].

(PERSON1) Yeah.

(PERSON6) Thatís right.

(PERSON4) Itís -

Yeah.

(PERSON6) Hm.

Yeah.

So, I donít know to what extend we can just copy paste our paper here?

(PERSON3) Hm...

I donít know.

But.

(PERSON4) I donít know either.

I can ask.

I can ask [PERSON9] and I will write him like the official -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Whether we can like for example copy the sections -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Or like the paragraphs for example from our papers or not.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) If it is OK.

(PERSON3) Hm.

But I think we donít want to copy all the, the paper what, with plenty of technical details.

We, we just -

(PERSON4) Yeah.

First, yeah.

We should, we should have some abstract.

(PERSON6) Yeah, maybe we can leave out the technical details.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON6) And put there the nice thing.

(PERSON4) But anyway -

(PERSON6) Nice images and some -

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON6) <unintelligible>.

(PERSON4) Itís for the, it, the part of the introduction -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) We could, we could copy.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON3) Yeah.

(PERSON6) And like the related work from the paper is actually what we kind of want to put here anyway cause -

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON6) Thatís, um, thatís what want to have here like not only the other paper but also other works.

(PERSON3) Um -

(PERSON6) Thatís basically what we did for the related work in that paper.

So, um, yeah, like itís kind of self-plagiarism but, um -

<laugh>

I donít know if it matters.

Um -

(PERSON4) I can a-, I can ask.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) [PERSON9].

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON3) Well, first, the first chapter is, is, is, is taken from my, from my dissertation.

(PERSON4) Yeah, th-, thatís right.

But that, thatís the dissertation.

Itís something else than, than the regular papers but anything, anyway I shouldnít <unintelligible> not, no problem.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) But I can ask.

(PERSON6) Hm.

Yeah.

And I guess, yeah, thatís it, so I think we just remove the sentence level representations we decide nobody (wants) it.

(PERSON3) Hm.

Hm.

(PERSON6) So, um, yeah, I guess that, thatís for me.

So, um...

So, itís now in a stage where it should be reasonably easy to, to add the missing information there and, and organize it into a readable way and, yeah.

(PERSON4) So, please, first organize the, the, the sections so that I can, I can send it to [PERSON9].

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Um, add these to table of contents -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) At least it looks somehow reasonable.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) And, yeah.

I would like to send it maybe on Thursday, so.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Tomorrow is the [PROJECT10] -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Day.

<laugh>

(PERSON6) OK.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON6) How, how prioritize that.

(PERSON4) OK, great.

So, maybe, maybe [PERSON1] can say what, what heís, what heís, what is he doing, so that [PERSON3]s know.

(PERSON1) Yeah.

So, um, Iím writing now survey mostly about, um, syntax in, um, neural networks.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON1) So using (mostly frozen) network and then probing it to find some syntactic information.

Um, so, yeah, the initial plan was to submit it to [PROJECT1] and -

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON1) I submitted abstracts and next week I should have it ready so.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

But I donít really, I donít send it to [PROJECT1] -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Because maybe -

(PERSON1) Yeah and itís also there, I donít know if <unintelligible> accept like this kind of -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON1) Overviews.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

They will accept it.

<laugh>

So that, yeah.

(PERSON6) I think they accept anything.

(PERSON4) They accept anything, yeah.

Yeah, maybe -

(PERSON1) I can also show you like the survey visualisation for that so -

(PERSON6) Hm, hm.

(PERSON4) Yeah, maybe I can, I can, I can share it, I have it here.

(PERSON1) (Just a) quite, quite <unintelligible>.

(PERSON4) I can share, um, share.

(PERSON1) It's very small.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON1) Yeah, thereís quite small.

Um.

(PERSON4) But I can download it and <unintelligible> pictures.

(PERSON1) Yeah.

(PERSON4) (Yeah, no time for pictures), but I donít know whether I can that, (turn) it in, in Overleaf.

(PERSON6) You can hide the left.

(PERSON4) Yeah, I can, I can.

(PERSON1) Oh, yeah.

Thanks.

Oh, yeah.

Um, so yeah, so, so itís mostly a thing what also [PERSON6] was talking about.

Comparison of different papers, um, so I done 4 comparisons and those are on that task of predicting part of speech, um, (type).

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON1) Because there is like most commonly found in the most number of papers that we, in like many (type) (re)configurations.

Um, and I compared, um, 4 pairs of approaches to that, 4 pairs of settings.

So, so in one pair there is probing of RNN hidden state versus static for embeddings so it could be the, um, it could be Glove or, or Word2vec.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON1) Um, so like the main idea of this is that each dot corresponds to, to one pair of results from one paper.

Um, itís hard to compare like dots between themselves bec-, because, um, like different paper use different, different types of data and think different <unintelligible> and there's like many different things.

But still, itís, itís, um, itís, um, possible to do a comparison between like two different, um, underlying systems.

So, so word embeddings and, um, um, recurrent neura-, neural networks.

Um, so, yeah, so this is like here everything from recurrent neural networks so is better then more the embeddings which is not thatís, thatís really.

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON1) Um, not a surprise, this transformer which is also higher.

But also, I done, um, comparison like for (rights), um, (plots), um, by the type of, um, pre-training task.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON1) So mostly language models and machine translation.

And actually, all of those results are from RNNs.

I havenít found anything when the compare transformers in one paper but there is like RNNs.

Um, but, yeah, there, there is the paper that said that, that machine translation is really better than, than language model, um, and -

No, language model is better than machine translation, um, but I, I couldnít like really say it from -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON1) Like from this paper -

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON1) It was, was, it was (cinder) but itís like different comparisons to different s-, mostly it came from the fact that language model had more data for pretraining.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON1) Then, then -

(PERSON3) Yeah.

(PERSON1) Machine translation.

Yeah and also machine translation vs. (out) encoders and here were machine translation definitely better and -

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON1) Encoders so there are quite not, not that good to, to have the, um, have the, these part speech encoded in them like mostly because, um, the, the task is very simple just to translate from lan-, one language to the same language so it <unintelligible>.

Ninety something percent personned lab and, but but, not really encode the part of speech.

(PERSON4) I think these figures could be included in, into our -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Because you are, you are -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) Writing about, about Belinnkovís.

(PERSON6) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

(PERSON4) These, these papers so -

(PERSON6) Yeah.

(PERSON4) It could be, could be -

(PERSON6) Yeah, I think it would be nice too, to include this.

Yeah.

(PERSON1) So, um, yeah, so, um -

(PERSON6) Hm, hm.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I think all of that would, would fit nicely.

(PERSON1) So this is all for part of speech.

(PERSON4) This is, these are only for part of speech <unintelligible> because, yeah.

Most of the papers are about probing for part of speech (tag) so.

(PERSON6) Hm.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I, I would like to have, to have it there, yeah.

(PERSON3) Yeah.

It seem nice.

(PERSON1) I, I also plan now to do some visualisation about transformers.

I think, I would (talk to) [PERSON4] about those.

So mostly about like the layer.

Whi-, which are the layers are the better -

(PERSON6) Hm, hm.

(PERSON1) That we compare like different, different, also different <unintelligible> probing part, different arch-, architecture.

This here -

(PERSON6) Hm, hm.

(PERSON1) Itís like on layer like usually thereís like middle layer are better or something like that.

(PERSON6) Hm, hm.

Yeah, yeah.

Um, that would be also nice.

Yeah.

So, yeah.

Like Iím not very good at visualisations.

<laugh>

Iím fine with writing the text but -

<laugh>

Um -

(PERSON4) Because some probing is, isnít there are not as many visualisation -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) As for, for the, these -

(PERSON6) Yeah, but, but these are, these are good.

<unintelligible>.

(PERSON4) Yeah, these are good.

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON3) Yeah.

We should also make sure that all the visualisations look at least similar.

(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah, so that is, theyíre for, for, yeah, my attention <unintelligible> is that they are really different.

(PERSON3) Yeah.

(PERSON4) <unintelligible>.

So, I have to, I have to regenerate them and, and, and all in the same colors -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) And fonts and -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) And...

(PERSON3) If you, um, if you're spending time with that I would, I would suggest, um, generating them as in, in, as PGF so itís, itís basically in, in, Tix and -

(PERSON4) PFG?

(PERSON3) PGF.

Itís, itís basically Tix with, with some LaTex macros and -

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON3) <unintelligible>.

(PERSON4) I, I <unintelligible> it will be the last thing I will, I will do ab-, I will first have them somehow -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON4) In some shape, um, there.

And if, if the text is OK, I will regenerate them, um, the format -

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) At the, at the end because <unintelligible> -

(PERSON3) If you, if you have a look -

If you have a look in deep learning images slash, um, <unintelligible>, underscore, encoding, um, you can, youíll see how to, how to set up, um, the LaTeX format.

Iíve been in -

(PERSON4) Oh, <unintelligible>.

(PERSON3) In, in our, in our depository.

(PERSON4) Aha.

(PERSON3) I, I, I have one image like this.

(PERSON4) You mean on GitHub?

(PERSON3) Thatís -

(PERSON6) In the book repository.

Right?

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON3) Yeah, in, in, in a book repository.

(PERSON4) Deep learning, IMG.

(PERSON3) Yes.

(PERSON6) You can see <unintelligible> is encoding PGF?

(PERSON3) Yeah, but I meant the, the, the Python script that -

(PERSON6) Hm.

(PERSON3) That generates that.

([PERSON2]) is underscoring, yeah, this one.

(PERSON4) This one.

(PERSON3) And you, you d-, do what I, what I do at the top would, um, after, um, after importing Matplotlib and then you just save it with, with PGF.

(PERSON4) Yeah.

(PERSON3) And ending and everything is generated in LaTeX.

(PERSON4) Hm.

(PERSON3) So, you then just do input in LaTeX and, and LaTeX would take care about all the forms that will be the same as, as in the rest in the book.

(PERSON4) Yeah, I figurate.

So, I, yeah, so I will update my, my scripts into my script.

(PERSON6) Yeah.

Good.

(PERSON4) Yeah, right.

So, anything else?

Anyone?

OK, so thank you.

So, see you next week and -

(PERSON3) Hm.

(PERSON4) Um, yeah, we should, we should discuss everything like, um, actually, in like during the, during the week so that we update it.

And, OK, so we have like only -

Yeah, we have only, yeah, yeah.

We have just two weeks.

OK.

So.

So, bye, bye, [PERSON3], and see you later.

(PERSON3) Alright.

Bye.

Have a good day.

(PERSON1) Bye.

(PERSON4) Disconnect [PERSON3].
