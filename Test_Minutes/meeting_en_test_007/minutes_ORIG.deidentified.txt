[PROJECT1] [PROJECT3] KUFR
• [ORGANIZATION1] platform:
o [URL1]
• This is a guest link, since we will be using it, I recommend to create your profiles, just write [PERSON7], because someone from [ORGANIZATION1] has to set it up.
(I think that might be a condition so you could be the presenter and share the screen.)
o Important:
• You have to use Windows or Mac
• Install [ORGANIZATION1] platform on your device (when you click on the link it will tell you to do it)
• You have to have a working webcam and headphones. This is really critical, [ORGANIZATION1] won’t work without a webcam.
• Updates on components:
o Presentation platform
• Any test client for video presentation in HTML by [ORGANIZATION6] for [PERSON14] to test?
• Generally good progress, maybe we will even have a very rough version next week.
• [PERSON7] asked for the possibility of text-only presentation platform.
o [PROJECT2] worker [PERSON1]
• A very basic module in C which communicates with the python server, tested in isolation, starting to integrate it into [ORGANIZATION6]-sample-client. [ORGANIZATION6]-production-client
o Production client [PERSON12]
• We need to fix batch mode for ASR and text-to-text workers
• Text-to-text from srt or txt batch mode on client side implemented and tested
• TODO batch mode for segmentations (textclient, ctm -> txt or srt)
o depends on the reported bug with “double free or corruption (out)” ([PERSON6], [PERSON11])
o depends on segmentation worker [PERSON5], now it doesn’t return anything ( [URL] )
• => we’re going to use the offline mode, solve this later
o [ORGANIZATION4] MT [PERSON12]
• I need to process 1300 TED talks to have training data on ASR output against reference
• The client must close automatically, not after pressing ctrl+c
• Depends on reliable ASR
• Depends on the text-to-text client and reliable batch mode
• I also need either the [PROJECT2] worker or textclient for ctm->txt (or, better, both), to get the final hypothesis and evaluate my current subsentence MT
• => send this to [ORGANIZATION5], use the offline mode and testing MT together with ASR
• => let’s see next week, if ASR necessity is blocking us
o [ORGANIZATION5] ASR workers: the bug [PERSON2]
• A session with [PERSON2] and [PERSON6] next week
o [ORGANIZATION5] segmentation and MT [PERSON5]
• How is the fix with batch mode and translating second and other sentence? -> made irrelevant, let’s ignore batch mode until [PROJECT3]
o [ORGANIZATION1]
• [ORGANIZATION4] will need a way to get a single audio with 
o [ORGANIZATION4] ASR:
• Remember that when a mediator dies, the worker needs to survive and reconnect again

• Participants of [PROJECT3]: 
o 6 Czech Republic (+ 6 organizers)
o 3 Germany
o 2 Austria 
o 2 Belgium
o 2 Hungary
o 2 Poland
o 2 Romania
o 1 Belgium-Dutch speaking
o 1 Netherlands
o 1 Spanish (probably)
