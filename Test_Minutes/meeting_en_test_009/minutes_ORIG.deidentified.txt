[PROJECT2] Surge organization
Thu Mar 19, 10.40

- ([PERSON14] will very likely come late or miss the meeting; please do your updates anyway.)
- !! I was asked to keep [ORGANIZATION3] room tight (there is serious need on teleconferences now), so:
-- The room will be only for 7 persons.
-- It will be shared with the room in which I will be remotely lecturing. So after the remote lecture, students will leave and you will enter.

- forced alignment
- OST file with sentence segmented text
- Antrecorp depth and test
- deadline for EMT
- test caraoke


- [PERSON5]
-- Forced alignment now-ready, but
- Seems like it misses a few words in the beginning of the chunk. [PERSON12] yet to verify...
-- Currently working on getting Karaoke style ready to assess the forced aligner.
-- [ORGANIZATION2] corpus - transcript processing. AntreCorp and [ORGANIZATION5]-consecutive + [ORGANIZATION5]-[PROJECT3]  speeches
- [PERSON5] needs to get all the input files for [ORGANIZATION5]-*, [PERSON10] has prepared those (by splitting [ORGANIZATION5]-consecutive into smaller chunks) and [PERSON1] knows where they are, too.
-- To do(s)
- IWSLT Data preparation- First priority. [PERSON15] to review the script first
- run the multi-source setup from the last mock conference to obtain log dirs.
- Calculate WER on czech transcript- with and without truecaser.
- [PERSON4]
-- Working with [PERSON3] on KonText scraping to improve language model when adapting for a domain
- I’ve managed to write a script for automated data harvesting (via curl)
- Awaiting feedback from [PERSON3]
- I also attempted to install the latest version of Bonito and Manatee (as suggested by [PERSON2]). I have them installed in Docker, but don’t really know how to run it. The documentation is nonexistent.
- Won’t pursue this endeavor, if not necessary.
- [PERSON1]
-- Preparing input text for force alignment
-- Selecting test set from [ORGANIZATION2]
-- Preparing some scripts for data preparation (they are available on GitHub now)
-- I'm waiting now for these stuff:
- New log outputs to test SLTev
- Output of force alignment
- [PERSON9]
-- Preparing test data (till now extracted  3,000 sentences for Polish, Russian, German)
-- Cleaning of the test data
-- Collection of Monolingual data (Due to unavoidable reason, the work was slow)
- [PERSON15]
-- Still finishing the paper about subtitler. One more day and it will be perfect :)
-- The translation latency with sentence-alignment catchup is there ← my new contribution
-- I realized that the measure in the leaderboard was not normalized erasure, but average erasure -- something different than in the [ORGANIZATION1]paper.
