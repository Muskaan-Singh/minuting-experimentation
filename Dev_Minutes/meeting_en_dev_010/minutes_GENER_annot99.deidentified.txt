The peers start discussing about how to present their papers in the IWSLT event.
The general agreement is to prepare pre-recorded presentations of the main 
results. They further discuss about the date of the project review and vote
for it. Meanwhile, they agree that they have to finalize the financial numbers
of the project sometime between July and August. The next topic of discussion 
is about the project deliverables and their dissemination. They decide to report
the papers in a table. The discussions that follow are about some technical
details of how to run the live demo of the ASR and MT system and its optimal
settings. At the end, they discuss about a possible extension request of the 
project by two or three months to overcome the delayes resulted from covid-19.
They also get back to the discussion about the IWSLT event and decide to 
contribute with slides and videos in a common overleaf document.
