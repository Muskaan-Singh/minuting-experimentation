Date: Unknown
Attendees: Ondřej Bojar, Peter Polák, Rishu Kumar, Dominik, Matúš Žilinec, Umar Faroog, Sangeet.
Purpose of meeting: discussing ELITR updates, setting up future meetings to do test runs and evaluate ELITR test sets

- Dominik's updates.
-- Transcripts for checking are almost done.
-- One transcriber from Germany is working now.
-- Dominik's mother is writing the questions for the German subtitle user study.
--- Progress from this study will be moved to the spreadsheet.
-- Started writing deliverables. 
-- Ondřej is hopeful about Bohdan's work, maybe contact him to remind him.

- Matúš's updates.
-- Matúš finished transcripts for the first 30 parts, for the next 10 parts it is still running. 
--- Issues: some files have weird output, the audio format is wrong.
---- But for most folders it is fine. 

- Ondřej thought of another possible task for Matúš. 
-- Training the empty systems to do the shortening. 
-- Similar to what Jörg Tiedemann is doing with the MeMAD project. 
-- Matúš could get implement the technique from Baidu: processing prefixes, which is much faster.
--- Our systems work with sequence to sequence, they process the entire sentence, which is slower.
-- Matúš would train the system to stop generating after some time. 
-- Update from Barry: Marian is not ready.
-- Candidates for this task: Matúš, Ibrahim, Pepa Jon. 
-- Matúš will check if this is realistic for him and how hard it will be to change the source code.
 
- Miscellaneous updates.
-- Rishu is setting up the presentations.
-- Umar has been working on adaptation for two domains. 
-- Rishu and Umar will have a call again and do a test run.
--- Test two concurrent subtitlings of videos without domain adaptations. 
---- That means that two (local) machines need to be operated. 
-- Rishu is also doing some ASR.
--- Issues with audio/video, some are not in the proper format. 
---- Needs manual override. 
---- Ondřej: this is critical, proper formats should be part of the automatic evaluation of ELITR test sets. 
---- Sangeet will help. 
-- Ondřej reminds everybody to do plenty of test runs: before you try, you never know what will be the problem.
-- Rishu and Ibrahim will have a call discussing the Khan Academy test set.
--- Umar should also join this call. 
-- Peter is finishing training German ASR that may be used for time stamping.
-- Ondřej needs to see the ASR numbers today asap and improved numbers by Monday.
-- Currently have two ASR workers.
-- Matúš: output for some folders is terrible, unintelligible audio. 

- Multiple custom dictionaries.
-- Peter and Umar are working on them. 
--- Put the two perspectives together.
---- Peter knows what he created in the dictionary, Umar knows what it looks like, he is creating it manually.
-- Discussing issues: a lot of empty noise in this dictionary.
-- To do: have various version of it, including only the words that were observed at least five times.
-- The dictionary will have three columns: grapheme (output), phoneme (different variations), grapheme (for all those variations). 
-- Peter will help Umar by changing the IPA phonemes into CMU
