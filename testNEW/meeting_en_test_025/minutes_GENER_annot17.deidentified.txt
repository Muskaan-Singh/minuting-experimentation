[PROJECT1] Remote Meeting
Date: Unknown
Attendees: [PERSON1], [PERSON2], [PERSON3], [PERSON4], [PERSON5], [PERSON6], [PERSON7].
Purpose of meeting: discussing [PROJECT1] updates, setting up future meetings to do test runs and evaluate [PROJECT1] test sets

- [PERSON4]'s updates.
-- Transcripts for checking are almost done.
-- One transcriber from Germany is working now.
-- [PERSON4]'s mother is writing the questions for the German subtitle user study.
--- Progress from this study will be moved to the spreadsheet.
-- Started writing deliverables. 
-- [PERSON1] is hopeful about [PERSON8]'s work, maybe contact him to remind him.

- [PERSON5]'s updates.
-- [PERSON5] finished transcripts for the first 30 parts, for the next 10 parts it is still running. 
--- Issues: some files have weird output, the audio format is wrong.
---- But for most folders it is fine. 

- [PERSON1] thought of another possible task for [PERSON5]. 
-- Training the empty systems to do the shortening. 
-- Similar to what [PERSON9] is doing with the [PROJECT3] project. 
-- [PERSON5] could get implement the technique from [ORGANIZATION2]: processing prefixes, which is much faster.
--- Our systems work with sequence to sequence, they process the entire sentence, which is slower.
-- [PERSON5] would train the system to stop generating after some time. 
-- Update from [PERSON10]: [PROJECT4] is not ready.
-- Candidates for this task: [PERSON5], [PERSON11], [PERSON12]. 
-- [PERSON5] will check if this is realistic for him and how hard it will be to change the source code.
 
- Miscellaneous updates.
-- [PERSON3] is setting up the presentations.
-- [PERSON6] has been working on adaptation for two domains. 
-- [PERSON3] and [PERSON6] will have a call again and do a test run.
--- Test two concurrent subtitlings of videos without domain adaptations. 
---- That means that two (local) machines need to be operated. 
-- [PERSON3] is also doing some ASR.
--- Issues with audio/video, some are not in the proper format. 
---- Needs manual override. 
---- [PERSON1]: this is critical, proper formats should be part of the automatic evaluation of [PROJECT1] test sets. 
---- [PERSON7] will help. 
-- [PERSON1] reminds everybody to do plenty of test runs: before you try, you never know what will be the problem.
-- [PERSON3] and [PERSON11] will have a call discussing the [ORGANIZATION4] test set.
--- [PERSON6] should also join this call. 
-- [PERSON2] is finishing training German ASR that may be used for time stamping.
-- [PERSON1] needs to see the ASR numbers today asap and improved numbers by Monday.
-- Currently have two ASR workers.
-- [PERSON5]: output for some folders is terrible, unintelligible audio. 

- Multiple custom dictionaries.
-- [PERSON2] and [PERSON6] are working on them. 
--- Put the two perspectives together.
---- [PERSON2] knows what he created in the dictionary, [PERSON6] knows what it looks like, he is creating it manually.
-- Discussing issues: a lot of empty noise in this dictionary.
-- To do: have various version of it, including only the words that were observed at least five times.
-- The dictionary will have three columns: grapheme (output), phoneme (different variations), grapheme (for all those variations). 
-- [PERSON2] will help [PERSON6] by changing the IPA phonemes into CMU
