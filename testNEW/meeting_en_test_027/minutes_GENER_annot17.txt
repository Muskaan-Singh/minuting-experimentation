- General updates for the MALACH event.
-- In need of somebody to take care of the recording. 
-- Likely that we will get some dictionary. 
-- It is in Czech.

-- This is the most urgent thing right now.
-- Clean up the evaluations.
-- Use simple auto-generated HTML tables. 
-- Create a conversion from the tables into HTML. 
-- Put the results regularly to Rishu's webpage / GitHub.
--- Useful for people outside UFAL so that they can browse it.

- Ondřej's updates.
-- Currently working on updating the demo paper submission and some project reports.
-- Also busy with minuting. 
-- Reminds everybody to work continuously over several weeks, not just before the deadline evaluation takes time.
-- With the subtitler study paper, we are aiming for the ACL deadline.

- Rishu's updates. 
-- He finished the deliverables. 
-- We have a statistic to represent the numbers. 
-- Rishu thinks we should also add a statistic to represent language pairs (English > German or vice versa)
-- Original plan was to get an idea about the word ration of the two languages for a given transcript.
-- Add other complementary metrics.
--- Profanity filtering evaluation: create a list of words which must not appear in output.
--- Rare words evaluation: create a list of words which we want to appear in output. 
-- This involves manual preparation of the reference.
-- Ivana Kvapilíková has compiled a translation dictionary and will share it soon, might be helpful. 
-- Rishu will have a call with Omar and then take a look at the lists.
-- Rishu should also create delay scores from some files from ELITR test set.

- Peter's updates.
-- Currently working on Kaldi, managed to compile it.
-- Now he is training the model on common voice. 
-- Rethinking the data set he will use for the experiment, maybe use Wall Street Journal or Library speech.
--- Ondřej says to definitely use more data sets, common voice alone would be too small.
--- Waiting for a reply from Karlsruhe about the data sets.
-- Peter is the one at UFAL who is training the ASR system.
--- Sangeet, Peter and Omar will have a call to discuss further.
---- Vicki will be a replacement for Omar, include him in the call too.

- Dominik's updates.
-- Released the ESI corpus to Bohdan. 
-- Trained speech language identification: Czech, German, English. 
-- Discussing ASR system details. 
--- Ondřej: we should have multilingual MT models and multilingual ASR / multiple ASR feeding into the same multilingual MT. 
---- Might lead to bad quality.
