Main points of discussion:

•	Independent of Interspeech.

•	Time period between proposal submission and final paper submission shortened from 5 to 3 months.
•	Submission deadline February 28, 2021 after community and ACL endorsement requirements were fulfilled. Interspeech decision to be received by March 15, 2021.

Advantages:
•	Great visibility in the science community.
•	Shared task submission possible.
•	Less work and more intense output.
•	Proceedings indexed in ACL Anthology, Google Scholar and other major industry players.
Disadvantages:
•	Requirement for corporate membership access.
To Do list for the Team:
