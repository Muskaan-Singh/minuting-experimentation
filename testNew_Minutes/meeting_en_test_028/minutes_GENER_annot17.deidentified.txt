Project updates 
Date: January 2021  
Attendees: [PERSON1], [PERSON2], [PERSON3], [PERSON4], [PERSON5], [PERSON6], [PERSON7], [PERSON8]
Purpose of meeting: discussing various updates: [PROJECT1] demo paper, evaluations, experiments, [PROJECT13]
 
- General updates.
-- Yesterday the session was disastrous: bad recognition and slow.
--- [PERSON1] asked [PERSON3] and [PERSON2] to debug, also get in touch with [PERSON10] about it.
--- The slowness happened because [PERSON3] wasn't connected into one of the machines. But this has no influence on recognition quality.
-- [PERSON2] added some files to [PROJECT1] test set.
--- [PERSON3] was asked to evaluate them: priority!

- [PERSON3]'s updates. 
-- Had a call with [PERSON11] yesterday.
-- Right now working on solving the problem of files that were too big to get uploaded to [PROJECT10].
--- Maybe will upload them as a link only.
-- Haven't heard from [PERSON12] if [ORGANIZATION6] server is up again or not. 
-- [PERSON1] reminds [PERSON3] to be in touch with [PERSON12] also about the extended set of target languages. 
-- [PERSON3] is also in touch with [PERSON13] about the text files.
--- [PERSON13] has set up [PROJECT3] by now. 
---- [PERSON1] says that we primarily need [PERSON13] to collect the domain specific text data. 
---- [PERSON1] clarifies that we are not interested in the [PROJECT2] Archive (interview with survivors of WW II), but in the historians' analyses and presentations. 
---- For the data, [PERSON13] should scan in breadth, rather than in depth.
---- People who have experience with [PROJECT3] should work with it instead of [PERSON13]. 
---- But [PROJECT3] is definitely useful in the long term.

- [PERSON1]'s updates.
-- Struggling with [ORGANIZATION10] demo papers, due tomorrow. 

- [PROJECT1] demo paper.
-- [PERSON5] should revise the [PROJECT1] demo paper and look at the reviews.
--- The reviews are not that positive: they don't like the paper, it has 'little impact'. 

- The experiments.
-- [PROJECT4] quality is very bad for all remotely handled sessions, especially if people wear face masks. 
-- Ideas for improvement.
--- Pass training data through [PROJECT12] in an automated way so that the data gets distorted.
--- Use a frequency filter to cut down on the high frequencies (this mimics what face masks do). 
--- Then it will be retrained by us or [ORGANIZATION4] (their system is online & fully integrated).
-- [PERSON1] will do that ([PERSON3] offered, but the priority for him is to work on evaluations). 

- [PERSON5]'s updates.
-- Working on data preparation of [ORGANIZATION9] corpus. 
-- Running the first alignments.
-- Will rerun the alignments of source and targets of the interpreters and analyze them.
-- Will write a paper with [PERSON14], who is currently busy with exams. 

- To do for [PERSON7].
-- Get in touch with [PERSON4] and process all the training data.
--- We need English on 25/1, Czech later: in February.

- [PERSON7]'s updates.
-- [PERSON7] summarizes the process of preparing pipeline / pipeline configuration tool. 
--- For every event, the pipeline is made a different way.
--- Pipeline consists of [PROJECT4], [PROJECT5] and online subtitles. 
--- [PERSON7] is writing a tool that will allow an operator to define all the components of a pipeline and how they are connected.
--- [PERSON1] suggested one more compilation target: probing if the pipeline components are up and running ('a test of availability', 'live debugging').
---- [PERSON7] will do that. 
-- Next Friday a [PROJECT2] conference, we will provide life subtitles and transcription.
--- We will need to get feedback about what's (not) working.
---- [PERSON7] to get in touch with [PERSON9] about that.

- [PERSON4]'s updates. 
-- Currently aligning the training data, building a more robust [PROJECT4].
-- Struggling to optimize the pipeline. 
-- [PERSON4] should talk to [PERSON17] about her [PROJECT11] tool and how they will be paid.

- [PERSON1] discussing alignment issues in German/English in [PROJECT13] with [PERSON6] and [PERSON8]. 
-- [PERSON6] will check and correct the progressive maximum, increase the numbers.
-- [PERSON1] discovered a mistake in the segmentation strategies: they are not proportional.
--- [PERSON6] will double check.
-- [PERSON1] will give access to [PERSON8]'s [PROJECT10] account to the [PROJECT1] test set.
