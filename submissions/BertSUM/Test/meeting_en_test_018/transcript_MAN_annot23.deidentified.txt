(PERSON6) So, [PERSON7] was sending me me a e-mail that he might be a little bit late.
Uh and other than that I think that's that's everyone.
(PERSON6) Okay, so we can try waiting for [PERSON7].
Where we just see whether it all works and just write a small paper out of it.
(PERSON4) Like, in like s- seven or ten days (of running this) experiment, there is like only two people who finished the-

(PERSON6) Mhm.
Like that's, three more weeks, if I'm correct.
[ORGANIZATION4] is N, double A, I don't know CL <laugh> I don't know how to say this names yet, but it's November the- the deadline.
So, it will be useful if I can access it.
So several uh- dozen thousand references, uh p- per sentence.
And uh, we have uh evaluations from [PROJECT6] as well, where people were uh creating uh-

S- so they actually the uh- the system outputs were manually post-edited and then someone else, a secondary annotator, confirmed whether they are good translation or not.
Uh, o- both of these are English to Czech.
I think that's- probably everything for [PROJECT2], right? I think, yeah, if I'm correct like we- we got the response or [PERSON10] already wrote an e-mail to the [ORGANIZATION5] [ORGANIZATION5] people but they, didn't reply yet, right? Or at least, I didn't receive any e-mail from them.
(PERSON9) Once we have the number of unique people and the number of segments in total uh that uh we have funding for, uh we can propose th- uh the set of documents, uh to discuss if we are fine with that.
Are uh ther- do we have any other options, or? Like-

The thing is that the experiment is taking way too long and it's being suspended too long and and maybe it's good idea to think about-

(PERSON4) The issue is that we don't have any native English speakers on our faculty.
(PERSON4) Okay but I would like to ask [PERSON9] whether there is some way to uhm, make some, more formal complaint about this? And-

(PERSON9) Oh- <unintelligible>-

(PERSON6) So so the thing is that <unintelligible>-

(PERSON4) [PERSON7] and I are (very) frustrated.
Um the- the short uh uh message is something which I was tel- telling at the very beginning.
Uh, but you know, I've looked at the website and it seems, like, eh it is progre-

But I'm not sure how how old that advertisement is-

(PERSON4) Well, the the issue is that we already agreed to do, to do the writing and so on.
And in conjuctio- in conjunction with uh [PERSON5] leaving? Uh okay so now we'll like-

I think in, two or three days, like if, if the tempo is the same, remains the same uh, I should have all the data translated.
(PERSON6) Yeah, I think I think that's-

(PERSON7) Or- or or or- at least to train a systems with uh with uh all the data, all the monolingual data, just to see whether it helps or not with- with this monolingual data included.
(PERSON7) Okay, because now we are like uh, now we are uh, releasing the pape- or publishing the paper for [PROJECT7], so okay w-, we can maybe somehow uh make uh, a like shorter version of it.
Because we have nothing else, or nothing more to, to publish.
Well it's it's just the that- that to keep that in mind, it would definitely give us some bonus points with the reviewers later, right.
(PERSON6) Uh, just a question-

(PERSON7) But yeah yeah, I I I'm I agree that uh this is the duty for [ORGANIZATION7] and uh yeah.
I'm not depressed, because I'm after a one week vacation, so <laugh>

(PERSON9) Yeah.
And let's uh-

Leaving that aside, uh anything else?
