So today is the deadline for, um, stop adding new content into the book.
It doesn´t mean to comment on text that is not finished at all.
I´m just planning to rewrite what´s already there, um..

<laugh>

[PERSON14] So you didn´t understand what, what it is content.
Maybe we should at least check the licence of the paper.
<laugh>

Yeah, it´s just (covereted) comments by so I only have to atribute the source.
[PERSON14] OK, the thing is one -

How many such pictures you would like to have in our book? Or I can generate some of pictures from maybe -

I, I plan to generate the picture from, from tabels which are in the, in the, in the papers so, so it looks better.
I didn´t want to put through it just other but then it´s true that I don´t know where to prove it like these are syntax but, but the the other ones like gender of nouns -

[PERSON21] Hm.
Um...

Yeah, I tried to group them just on (through) things like syntax or semantics but, um, often I actually did not very sure, um.
[PERSON14] Because this is <unintelligible>, this is, um, GPT? Yeah, the, the pictures will be, will be changed within so the-, they, they should be nicer but, um...

5.2, syntactic function, dependency trees, so yeah.
And yeah, maybe we will, we will remove this table, I don´t know.
And yeah, then there´s this 3.2 which I´m not sure if it belongs here or what to do with it but I think we can decide that at the end.
<laugh>

[PERSON20] At the other one would, would totally different fonts and -

[PERSON24] Yeah.
[PERSON20] Um...

[PERSON24] But yeah, also I think this is -

[PERSON20] That´s (line) only say that, um, that you can find the, um, the probability value for word at depositions it´s...

It doesn´t mean any like computational connection.
[PERSON14] OK, so please, um...

When you finish your part made the lines in the, in the [PROJECT3] schůzky document, um, green.
<laugh>

Ugly pictures in the -

<laugh>

[PERSON21] <unintelligible>.

So yeah, so they have like the -

<other_noise>

(PERSON1), <unintelligible>.
[PERSON14] One of conclus-

[PERSON20] Um...

I´m not sure if it´s, if it´s the same? [PERSON6] Yeah, anyway would we put something different into a book conclusion and into a book summary? [PERSON14] But...

[PERSON20] [PERSON24] brought some books.
But this is like related work is included.
[PERSON6] But it´s -

[PERSON14] Yeah, but this is, this is, yeah, this is in the table.
[PERSON6] Um...

[PERSON14] But -

[PERSON6] I don´t know.
[PERSON20] So what´s time is the meeting? [PERSON6] But I did, I didn´t check the ACL website.
[PERSON24] Do you have to be registered for the tutorials? [PERSON20] Um, but you can, you can ask questions live on [ORGANIZATION1].
[PERSON6] I think it should work (badly) if you´re here and somebody else also wants to watch the same thing and he´s registered which I don´t know if, if it will be true.
