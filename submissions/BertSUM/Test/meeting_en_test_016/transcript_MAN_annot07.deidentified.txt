(PERSON12) <another-language>
Yes, I can hear someone.
(PERSON18) I can hear you guys properly, but lower clear, but -
(PERSON12) Yeah, [PERSON21] is guess I don't know what <unintelligible>
<another-language>
(PERSON18) He should be there.
The purpose of these meetings is for everybody to say,what they are working on,
and what they have in mind for the upcoming weeks,
and the reason is for me to collect this credits.
(PERSON12) Yes, I'm talking too fast I guessand the microphone is not perfect.
So the point of the call is to make sure,that people know, what others are doing,
and they nicely, well like a collaborate, in the sense that no work is done twice.
So there is the again, university open day, next Wednesday,
for which we are doing domain adaptationand then there will be on the 12th of February a dry run of the workshop,that we are going to give for the [ORGANIZATION4] congress.
And progress more on the[PERSON2] 36 36 empty models and doc translation, and basically like <unintelligible> that [PERSON15]
so that the work is not duplicated again, as more on their size.
(PERSON12) Yes, so, it depends where I am if I 'm on the correct side of the microphone, or not perhaps, as well.
(PERSON7) I- I don't know the efficiency.
Because I was s- I spent like last weekend on preparing for the Monday seminar.
So what I am going to do next, is that we can take a- any of the Monday seminar revised transcript 
and we can to take that as a test set,
and we can do as uncompressed and check the word error rate,
and  we can do a compressed pipeline and again check the word error rate
and let's see, how it goes, so here we got some propose.
(PERSON12) A thing, that [PERSON23] was talking about -
(PERSON7) <unintelligible> to collaborate with [PERSON20] and what we did.
I know, into the end yesterday, maybe no one account working on because we had a problem of segmentation.
As you know, for example the segmentation in the difference part, could should shouldn't necessary - 
Is the same as the segmentation.
(PERSON12) And it would be great, if you could set up -
(PERSON4) Exactly.
Yes, it's could be caused after start, which and I can have a- <unintelligible> which can I have a meeting with [PERSON14],
and we can test everything <unintelligible> so.
(PERSON12) Yeah, so the next one is [PERSON15].
(PERSON11) It' a <unintelligible> the name of this <unintelligible>.
(PERSON12) Yeah, okay, so It could be language dependent.
So it's- it it's mutual- mutually beneficial.
So my job's to to have an overview of all the data, we use for for the [ORGANIZATION4] Congress.
We would really like to to run the regular evaluation.
We are working on English to Czech languages <unintelligible>.
So ASR all ASR languages to- to the English.
What data set can use for Czech to English? Setups, that you can use, in the pipeline, that are already integrated.
(PERSON3) <other_unrecognisable speech="">.
So I 'm the a -
At least, and maybe it is not totally <unintelligible> of you, but it's clearing my head,
what we should should try with the -
<unintelligible> translation before this Wednesday.
I would like to use some in-domain data from -
Like European data to train the segmenter, like English and Czech segmenter
and use [PERSON10]'s evaluation tool to see, how they are doing.
(PERSON4) And I think I'm available next week and whenever you want, we can we can have a meeting together.
