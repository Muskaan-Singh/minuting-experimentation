(PERSON5): Ye, Ye, Ye
No, no, I'm just aligning that link of the web interface, which is already there one in the corrector-
(PERSON8): So [PERSON4] we have discussed with [PERSON5] your negotation.
(PERSON4): I did with you [PERSON8] for like I have to collect the minutes so-
I don't understand this upload thing.
(PERSON8): Yes, so for each transcript in europarl you can find the minutes.
And here here we are not on within the [ORGANIZATION2] website.
(PERSON5): [PERSON8], I have linked the reference in the agenda.
So you want to just see that what they are following like the based or is it some kind of the-
So they have shown us a snapshot of the interface which they have done for the annotation tool
(PERSON8): But what should I do with that? How they have built this tool for annotation of the valuation.
But this is just a web application which they have shown the snapshot.
It does have web application front-end which.

I think you just come up with what you consider to be the best.
So what you've already done is very beautiful.

And that's what I was asking that building an interface would be a good thing.
(PERSON5): So let me share the draft maybe.

Okay so I will send the-

So that would be the human judgement, right? (PERSON8): And anyways it has a sense to speak about it after we see your <unintelligible> criterias.
Ye [PERSON5] please also while you put your criterias please also evaluate two minutes-
(PERSON5): Hmm, okay
(PERSON4): Okay, so that we can have the same set up of what good and bad minute looks like.
(PERSON8): Yes, everybody-
(PERSON4): With the transcript, ye.
Definitely they are also gonna have judge.
(PERSON4): Yea, no, I thought the matrix that you that you did.
(PERSON5): Yea, so I did try with our data.
And [PERSON5] and please also send the automatic evaluation that the paper of <unintelligible> want to.
