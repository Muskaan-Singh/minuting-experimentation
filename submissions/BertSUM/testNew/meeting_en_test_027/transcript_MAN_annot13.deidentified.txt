And just to be complete we are also going to also talk about the the nominal <unintelligible> of-.
And my holidays were also not kind of like that fun.
So I am, I'm like I will be quite honest because I'm like slumbered with the homework, the  
assignments and exams approaching.
<laugh>
Uh, I'm I'm sending a question to [PERSON5] now, so the the second event, the [PROJECT3] will have two  
parts.
And, like, the more important and still persisting topic to to work on is the ladder climbing and  
I've suggested here uh, in the uh, uh, in the uh, paragraph for [PERSON3], uh,
that we could use simple HTML tables that would be auto generated, and that would grow.
So I think that that would be probably the easiest, uh, to just put up the tables as HTML.
So that means moving the few scripts to, uh, where they belong from [PROJECT1] test set and some  
automatic runner.
I'm now, uh, working on, uh, getting to update the, um, demo paper submission, which is due next  
Friday, if I 'm not mistaken.
So I guess we had a proposed that if there are some lines which are coming from, uh, [PROJECT5] and we  
want to remove it.
Uh, scored, uh, not simply by word error rate but, scored by something which directly accounts, uh, 
these things, right? Uh, so this would be the rare, uh, words, uh, eval for [PROJECT10] and then from [PROJECT2] we are also likely  
to get some dictionary.
And [PERSON3] could I ask you to to revise the [PROJECT8] domain and creates such a dictionary by looking at  
the outputs and what is missing in the outputs.
So probably I will have one call with him next Monday.
I had to come almost come from the back from it.
So you see, that like, it's is despite, it seems simple, it actually takes time, and we need to  
work this way.
(PERSON3) <unintelligible>
(PERSON1) You will need to be in touch with [PERSON7], as you said, uh, because we need to revive, uh, the  
[PROJECT4].
And there are also non native speakers there, many, non native speakers, mostly Indians and so on.
And, uh, so when I said that [PERSON16] is owing us the list of [PROJECT14] data and other links, they actually  
have already provided these, uh, links in some way.
You know, the directory where to where to put these things.
(PERSON2) So I mean, I think the sooner I get started working on it the sooner I will be able to I, I  
will be able to build the-
Uh, I I do not know, because I haven't done this in the past.
Great, so I'm happy that we have not missed this.
(PERSON1) Uh, uh, yes, you're talking about the what is his name.
That's my fault, it's on my " to do" list.
And for the language ID I'm curious, how do you want to integrate it exactly.
<other_noise>
Depending on the <unintelligible>.
So, please keep thinking about, uh, this, uh, like what are our pipelines.
Ideally, uh, uh, I think that uh, the, the, least, uh, like, management, 
confusion, and, and, so on would arise if our [PROJECT10] models were multilingual.
And they do not have an intermediate language.
So it is direct from one language to another.
I think it very much depends on the data available.
