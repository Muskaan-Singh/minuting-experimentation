(PERSON1) Hmm, mmm, mmm, today, I am in the office today.
<laugh>
(PERSON2) <laugh>
(PERSON1) Is [PERSON3] joining us? (PERSON2) Yes, I am so <unintelligible> you are usually there on time.
Uh, not really for shared tasks, which are very focused.
Ah, but the thing is that we have to do much like almost double work with this.
It is like a mini conference that you want to do.
(PERSON3) I would propose both, [PERSON1].
(PERSON1) If we made this kind of workshop, the satellite.
So they are supposed suppose during this three months to, uh, write a program.
Uh, if you are if your proposal is accepted for a workshop, uh, then we have much more independence 
than special session.
So it is entirely up to us then, wha- when to float the deadline.
Uh, take care of all those stuff on our own.
(PERSON1) If they accept us both to [ORGANIZATION5] and uh, uh, this [ORGANIZATION4].
Just, uh, like we have to manage this submission and do our thing.
Because both have a very good visibility.
(PERSON3) Like, I have seen workshops in [ORGANIZATION6] having two or three submissions only.
But we have to take out institutional membership.
(PERSON3) Okay, no, I'm just asking, suppose [PERSON1] where, we have to pay some fees somewhere for our  
workshop.
And to make a website for our propo-, uh, for our shared task.
(PERSON1)  I 'm not really interested in all these points.
But ,uh, I didn't make a  a reche-, a research about ,um-, what is-.
(PERSON2) It depends on, depends on the participants actually.
So if he is aware of this, then I think he can be interested in.
So one good thing for, uh, going for <unintelligible> and would be,  uh, if we go for  
<unintelligible> , uh, the proceedings would be indexed with [ORGANIZATION6] anthology.
(PERSON1) I would say that the <unintelligible> is better than [ORGANIZATION4] workshop.
(PERSON3) Yes, he says, that either either we can go for [ORGANIZATION9] or we can go for [ORGANIZATION8].
(PERSON2) So I think, uh, [ORGANIZATION8] is very famous to the entire machine translation community at least.
Um, the proceedings of some conferences and workshops.
I will be glad to read the proposal and to, uh, to write some chapters to the proposal, so-.
(PERSON1) Yes, yes, unfortunately, it is double work.
