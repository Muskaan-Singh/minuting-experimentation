So welcome, I told [PERSON5] so that in-, include, join our, um, [PROJECT2], um, project, um, because currently he is working on survey about, um, about getting sim card, <unintelligible> sim card, eh, from transformers, from <unintelligible> neural network so this, um, this is connected our book.
So maybe, um, you could invite him as well to the, to write in the book.
And at least you should, you could read, read the book and criticised our book and tell us what is missing and what is, um, is on.
So if you want to side money -

<laugh>

I will <unintelligible>.
Semi-virtual organization will be considered but as an optional addont.
[PERSON8] Also <unintelligible> for conference, that doesn´t <unintelligible>.
[PERSON5] I don´t no, what is in [LOCATION3].
<laugh>

[PERSON8] We can just with on Monday.
<laugh>

[PERSON8] There, there we will have to <unintelligible> much about the paper and -

[PERSON13] Yeah, I think there, yeah.
<laugh>

We don´t now what´s going to happen there.
[PERSON10] We don´t have to write it right now.
The next point -

OK, so that [PERSON5] could have <unintelligible> section in the book, in our book.
[PERSON8] So this is already -

[PERSON13] This is already done because we have one paper from [PROJECT4] and other from [PROJECT5] and now that this one is, yeah.
So maybe we will have but we don´t know yeat but -

[PERSON8] Hm.
And but I have only some of the visualisation because only, only some of there were in our experiment with [PERSON8] so I will need to, to generate, um, to get the, get the same or the similar metrices from the, um, from the [PROJECT3] as well so I, I´m planning to, um, to -

Maybe you already have something? To that we write it only once and no twice.
So I haven´t continue with this, this week so but I would like to finish it somehow, maybe I will, yeah...

[PERSON8] Let´s go so moving forward now.
But I will, I expect to send you, um, something by the end of the week.
[PERSON13] The deadline is, it was posponed to the middle of August.
[PERSON13] So, um -

[PERSON8] OK and [LOCATION7] is nice so if it´s physicall then -

[PERSON13] Yeah, if it´s fysicall it´s, it will be nice so...

[PERSON5] Yeah, I think have try to send it there an older <unintelligible>.
[PERSON5] Yeah, so -

[PERSON8] Hm, hm, hm.
I will need to go trough, trough all the mails I´ve, I´ve get from [ORGANIZATION3] and see what I can do with the, with this money but we can buy something on equipement or I, I -

[PERSON8] Yeah, we can buy some equipement.
[PERSON13] I could, I could, but we, we have always like the survey like (sixtate) 60000 so <unintelligible> like for -

But yeah, for [PERSON5] to introducing to this for couple of months.
It´s probably the least, least wasteful way of spending the money on.
[PERSON13] I don´t know how it will be the next year <unintelligible> get less money because this, this other finished and you -

[PERSON8] I can ask [PERSON2] if -

[PERSON13] Yeah, yeah, I will, I will ask [PERSON2] and money how would be <unintelligible> some reason.
[PERSON8] So, so in the budget you have no, no money for investing -

[PERSON13] No.
Because it-, it´s not a computer, it´s officialy equipement like if you are fysic or something like that.
[PERSON13] But anyway if he, if he will pay for, um, all the, the <unintelligible> for [PROJECT7] or for black boxes to, to we will not end up with much more -

[PERSON8] Hm.
<laugh>

And -

[PERSON13] You mean all of us here in [LOCATION2]? <laugh>

<unintelligible> says that we can come but I really not all of us but we can come.
