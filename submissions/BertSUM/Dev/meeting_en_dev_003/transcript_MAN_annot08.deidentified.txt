(PERSON3) Ensure that I have followed the guidelines that you have sent.
And and the other think if now we have to really (mobilize) our efforts tools the proposals.
(PERSON3) So the <unintelligible> [PERSON5] like uhm I <unintelligible> late personally I would prefer the shared task to be as simple as possible, 
because even the task is hard.
(PERSON5) So actually, 
why we want to run this [PERSON4] 's tool is that <unintelligible> has actually no real sense run estimating the summariz on the one hand, 
and on the other hand that manual metrix, manual evolutions that we have now are very very subjective and uhm kind of also very wake.
The only thing that is <unintelligible> too properly align with the properly align with the corresponding trasncripts.
(PERSON3) So I 'm saying that for for the you-
(PERSON5) Firts, so.
(PERSON3) And <unintelligible> with to you <unintelligible> finally data.
(PERSON3) Yeah, so one thing that we need to be sure about the tool is like the tool is doing annotators uhm like alignment <unintelligible>.
So but the thing is that once the once the annotator does the alignment,
so what is the output of the tools.
It should be some manual score or metric or what.
So that I think you need some discussion.
We sh- uhm
Yes, this is important question.
(PERSON3) So yes, for example, if you see uhm that (Jens) that minutes fix just smaller part of the transcript 
or uhm then so then they get less as smaller number of kind of in these evaluation.
Similar I think <unintelligible> go for summarization when we see that <unintelligible> models <unintelligible> very good.
So <unintelligible> we have other type of data somehow,
that not just big one hour long transcripts,
and long too pages long minutes.
(PERSON5)  I 'm not sure if I'm say- saying it clear enough.
Because there are still many questions unanswered.
But there is some connection is missing that.
I think it-
(PERSON2) I'm here <unintelligible>.
We started an hour earlier than normally today.
(PERSON3) Yeah,
if you if you want to start uhm you can.
And and how we how the work could be started.
(PERSON5) Are are <unintelligible> I 'm looking forward to started from this from September, 
because I think we have a lot of data
and I 'm so I 'm still (waiting on terms) for creating uhm kind of uhm double summarize for meetings that are already minuted.
I think about that, 
and probably excludes some <unintelligible> meetings, 
and some other meetings 
and I uhm I will definitely start with imaging center of the shore <unintelligible>.
(PERSON2) So [PERSON5] what exactly do you want as one from us like to start the annotation work, because I think we should do it as soon as possible, 
because it will it is going to get a lot of time.
You can tell me whatever you one may help with.
(PERSON5) Uhm I didn't speak to him, 
I didn't so uhm we don't have the con- concrete topic to ask him,
so so I didn't do it.
(PERSON5) If you noted to the agenda, 
it will be it would be great.
So I think I think we can have something by the end of the week for all of this.
[PERSON5], you should you should have it by the end of this week.
