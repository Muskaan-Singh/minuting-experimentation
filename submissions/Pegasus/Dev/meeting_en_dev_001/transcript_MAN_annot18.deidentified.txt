The[PERSON19] Okay, um, so I m still missing the introduction so it s stil this, um, this, this (bullets) which I plan to rewrite into the text like one to put this text away.
And I still didn t touch morfology so I still need to rewrite it into sentences.
But the rest of the book or as rest of my chapture now should be kind of (OKish) so, um, it s ready for comments I would say.[PERSON19] So the different where you say [PERSON13] and al say something, shouldn t we rather say we, we say something?<n> [PERSON19] So the different where you say [PERSON13] and al say something, shouldn t we rather say we, we say something?[PERSON19] Yeah, I think, yeah.
It, it looks better if we refer to our work in, in the same way as, as the other.<n> [PERSON6] Hm.
I don t know.
On the other hand if you refer to your papers as someone else s paper it looks like, um, what do you call it in English, like don t appeal to authority which is not there like...[PERSON19] Hm.
[PERSON6] The reader has the right to know that - [PERSON19] Hm.
[PERSON6] You might be biass to - [PERSON9] Hm.
[PERSON9] Our papers.<n>And by pretending that like or pretending, nice, refering to the paper as someone else s paper you I (disbiass) from the reader.<n>And by pretending that like or pretending, nice, refering to the paper as someone else s paper you I (disbiass) from the reader.Briefly see what is, what is missing there or what, what s not.
Briefly see what is, what is missing there or what, what s not.<n>Let s go from the beginning to the end of the book and see what is, what is there.
Briefly see what is, what is missing there or what, what s not.[PERSON19] Okay, so the section about the neural language models should maybe be merged to the previous chapture or deleted if it s (superfilus)<n> [PERSON6] OK, so the section about the neural language models should maybe be merged to the previous chapture or deleted if it s (superfilus)Unsupervised methods are described in PCA and ICA .<n>Unsupervised methods are described in unintelligible> unsupervised .[PERSON6] So...
Then probing is defined or?<n> [PERSON9] So I haven t, I haven t read that but, but, yeah.
We should say what we mean by probing and, um, put the history of this theme that probing in the, yeah - The past it was these model, is that use for many, many methods, different methods and...
[PERSON2] (Also) the ICA tutorial was talking about, about behaviour texting.
Are we mentioning this too?<n> [PERSON6] Um...
Not yeat.
[PERSON19][PERSON6] Well, I have (send) directly into (livelive) or what is also, you can watch it there.
Hm...<n>And there is also a part about interaction and I m not sure if we want that as a section?<n>And there are examples here and...
Oh, behavioral analysis.
And there are examples here and...
Oh, behavioral analysis.Chelling talks about how to come up with hypotheses that can be later quantitatively tested .<n>The interactive visualisation is like a technic (dot), can speed (dot) exploration but they don t really consider it .<n>The classifires are like a discussion around should the classifires be simple or should they be powerfull and memorization .[PERSON19] Hm.
[PERSON6] Um...
Um, this is also unsupervised method, the neural.<n> [PERSON19] Hm.
[PERSON6] Um, this is also unsupervised method, the neural.<n> [PERSON19] Hm.
[PERSON6] Um, this is also unsupervised method, the neural.[PERSON9] You didn t train anything but you re constructing, um, you re like - Yeah, like you constructed a supervise data set.<n> [PERSON6] Like there have to be a person who decides if, if - [PERSON19] Hm, hm, hm.Add the other methods to unsupervised methods because defined that only that unintelligible>.[PERSON19] Hm.
[PERSON6] OK and now I m starting to get your point.
Hm, hm, hm, hm...
OK, now I m starting to get your point.<n> [PERSON2] Well, I m asking question who are the people and the answer is these are machine learning people.This chapture is about the general term, concept of interpretation .<n>There are no general consensus on what interpretation means .<n>If there is something specifical for NLP, we should say unintelligible> in NLP unintelligible> usual .[PERSON6] But my chapture is end of story.<n> [PERSON9] I don t know whether we should have the two sections on the book so maybe we can .<n>The only chapture of the third part, the third part is the summary.When it s just called summary, it s not very clear like suddenly this is all unintelligible> summary of the whole book .<n>It would also make sense to part a part after the second chapture, before the third .In the introduction we don't have a summary.
Maybe it will be better if summary were somewhere there .<n>Also we want the unintelligible> number the things at the beginning in unintelligible> Roman numbers .Comment mainly what is missing .<n>Add something to the last, last, um, last section what is unintelligible>.<n>Check the list of figures maybe we should add some unintelligible>.[PERSON19] I deleted, I deleted all the meetings, um, starting the next year, because - laugh> unintelligible>.<n> [PERSON19] Hm.
[PERSON19] What we have promised.
So - [PERSON19] Hm.
[PERSON19] Only thing is this book so...[PERSON19] Hm.
[PERSON19] Hm.
[PERSON19] discussed the problems in, in, in the book so - [PERSON19] Hm.
[PERSON19] So the 21th I can delete? [PERSON19] 21th, yeah.
Um...
I will probably not - I don t know.
Um...
I will probably not - I don t know.
So you all are here? The next - [PERSON6] So.
[PERSON19] Maybe - [PERSON19] unintelligibleWe ll - [PERSON19] Hm, the meeting after would be OK.
[PERSON9] I m not here the week after.
The first week of, of the, so - But I m suppose if, if it s that the - [PERSON19] The book will be finished already.[PERSON19] unintelligible> professor.
[PERSON6] [PERSON25] unintelligible>.<n>[PERSON6] unintelligible> these are professors but I don't know.
Let s, let [PERSON2] see.
laugh> So it s full professor here.[PERSON19] I don t know if there are some people who are unintelligible> - [PERSON19] Do you know them?<n> [PERSON19] I don t know where we go to ask someone which really in, in this are interpretability or maybe we can ask someone else in NLP.
Cause this book is also unintelligible> working for someone .Someone from [LOCATION3] see like more inter-, like more unintelligible> area of interpretability and [PERSON22] is only unintelligible> NLP and other .<n>Someone from [LOCATION3] see like more inter-, like more unintelligible> area of interpretability and [PERSON22] is only unintelligible> NLP and other .
