(PERSON3) Hello, can you hear me now? (PERSON3) Yes, yes, it works.<n> (PERSON3) So I'm happy that- to see that it works even without any installation.<n> (PERSON3) Okay, well, it seems that we have many people already.<n> (PERSON3) Okay, well, it seems that we have many people already.(PERSON3) Well, we have to pick which paper, uh, probably one paper I guess.<n>Twice at 9 am and 6 pm Seattle time, so essentially, European time, US time.<n>20 minutes poster, 5 minutes pre-recording uh, pre-recorded talks unintelligible>(PERSON3) Okay, so it's because the the review will postpone till September.
And we should give uh, our project officer the new ah, a new date.<n>And I see more people finally voted it, so maybe there is a chance to to pick a date.<n>Okay, so thanks for thanks for your vote and we'll see uh, what what comes out and we'll let you know maybe already now.The EU gives us 2 months actually to to finalize these numbers .<n>So expect that at the boundary of July and August, there would be some paper with necessary on your side and especially in your respective financial departments .(PERSON3) Yeah, this this numbers should come from your financial department anyway as sum.<n> (PERSON3) Still, I would like you to get in touch, or maybe link directly you financial people with uh, with us.<n> (PERSON12) Okay, great we will we will tell the - We have 1 1 person in our finance department, who was responsible for the E- European stuff, so we all European projects will talk to unintelligible> she will come back to us.This report has to be written by [ORGANIZATION10] but everybody should contribute their data .<n>What we were we need especially more input is in the scientific dissemination part and the workshop and NLP technologies .<n>For all the papers, which acknowledge uh, [PROJECT3], let's probably think that the best place is indeed this report .I'm not sure that- It doesn't seem a great format really, but (PERSON3) Yeah, exactly doesn't seem uh, as a good format.<n>For regular paper submissions, which have a conference presentation, I would not put them into this table.<n>The sum of our dissemination activities will be this table plus papers.
So the sum of our dissemination activities will be this table plus papers.(PERSON21), please make sure that we we do it, that we examine like what has to be done, and we'll let you know in a week or 2 uh, in what format we need your papers.<n> (PERSON22), please make sure that we we do it, that we examine like what has to be done, and we'll let you know in a week or 2 uh, in what format we need your papers.<n> (PERSON23), please make sure that we we do it, that we examine like what has to be done, and we'll let you know inThe workshop is for people not familiar with NLP .<n>We have reviewers in the table written for all the deliverables .<n>We need to submit all these deliverables uh, uh, at the latest on June .This week's episode focuses on the delays caused by the recent power outage .<n>Shows how the team tries to work out what the new date for the Congress is .<n>And how to contact the project officer if you have any further questions .(PERSON3) Let's do the internal pole, uh, and let's fill it uh, the internal pole during the end of this week.<n>And then uh, on Monday, or Tuesday the latest, uh, let's have the dates, um, ready the options, ready for [PERSON6].<n>And then uh, on 1 of the days um, uh, of the uh, in the 2nd half of June.<n>The demo will tentatively take place in in on 1 of the days um, uh, of the uh, in the 2nd half of June.Learn how to run docker containers without root on a virtual machine .<n>Shows how to package systems and get back to [PERSON8] and [PERSON14] for for this system .<n>Next, we'll try to package our systems and get back to [PERSON8] and uh, and also [PERSON14] for for this system .(PERSON3) Okay, you said, that there was the like the old Python virtual environment and everything got fixed when the virtual environment was recreated.<n> (PERSON16) If you if you mean um, space, or another virtual machine, or or whatever.
The the only um, uh, open point for me is the uh, GPU configuration.(PERSON3) unintelligible> like a virtual machine image .<n> (PERSON19) Just unintelligible> like a virtual machine image .We need to test the unintelligible> feature for use, basically .<n>But German to English 1st unintelligible> is translation is more interesting directly .We are finally getting to that like kind of regular testing of the systems integrated in the pipeline .<n>We will be regularly running different set-ups, uh, and the the frozen fingerprints would be then uh, the thing to demo .We already have the the documents, so [PERSON1] has not uh, not filled this yet, but we are in.<n>This would allow us to directly evaluate, which systems are the best.<n>We can do in the demo we can do for example the same video uh, presented twice.<n>Once with the like properly devset chosen uh, system and for the 2nd time uh, using the test uh, set chosen system, which is the cheating.This is what is the best performance that we can deliver, uh, a kind of test.
Please, let me know, if you had any problems with uh, with this goal.<n>Whether we want to make use of the Covid crisis to get little time extension, uh, little or longer time extension, of the project.<n>We finish the project to December and writing deliverables in December is always- It's not great, really.(PERSON3) unintelligible> (PERSON2)<n>(PERSON3) unintelligible> (PERSON2)<n>(PERSON3) unintelligible> (PERSON3)parallel_talk> [PERSON20] will share Overleaf uh, anybody uh, welcome to contribute.<n>The deadline for the recorded demo is alread- it's the 17th of June and uh, the idea is that probably [PERSON20] will present uh, that uh, with s- like a s- screen sharing uh, recorded with uh, little not avatar, but [PERSON20]s head himself in in the corner of the slide.I'm happy and let's proceed like that for the rest of the project .<n>I think we are doing good.
Uh, a number of doodle pools is to come .<n>I'm happy and let's proceed like that for the rest of the project .
