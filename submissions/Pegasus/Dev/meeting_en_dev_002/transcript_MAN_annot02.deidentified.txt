(PERSON8) So we are expecting [PERSON1] today?<n> (PERSON6) Yes, he has just written an email asked for the address now are we and I have answered him.<n> (PERSON6) Ehm.
that there is an appointment on visa embassy, right.<n>Because of covid the officers are like semi open and -.<n>It's hard to me.
(PERSON4) I think [PERSON1] is joined.<n> (PERSON6) So it's all unintelligible> situations where some debate, which is not like preread, prewritten documents(PERSON6) I think that more importantly, we should definitely have the uh, have AMI and ICSI data in there.<n> (PERSON6) Well, the problem is AMI is also that it is very different from the point of view off summaries.
Because (thought) real meetings in our understanding of meetings, but they have one paragraph abstracts of coherent texts.
So, this is also different.<n>So it would be like a contrast, if summary a non-standard, an alternative summary of the um, for the AMI meeting.We are in different languages that for also kind of complication, this is then normal speech and normal dialogues, but they are translated so .<n>The transcripts are very good, I'm sure.
But the summaries are already boring and creating our own .<n>The question is how much data we need for the share task .In speech translation you uh, or uh, or uh, or speech recognition 2 hours are what you want .<n>There were no speed summarization share tasks for a long time .<n>Some share tasks were only 80 hours of data .15 meetings of the like if your score would be just one word scroll like a good or bad.<n>Then you have the quality, final quality scale, precise to the to tens of percents.<n>That means that on your full scale, you divide the 100 percent into 15 uh, steps.<n>So we will get enough, uh, variance on the on the scale.Transcripts are a great way to keep track of meetings .<n>But they can take up to 10 minutes to produce .<n>Use the Transcripts tool to search for and print out minutes .Use the weekly Newsquiz to test your knowledge of stories you saw on CNN.com .<n>The weekly Newsquiz tests your knowledge of stories you saw on CNN.com .(PERSON1) So can we just use these IDs? This sessions have.
(PERSON6)<n>So, these IDs cannot be used to search for minutes.
So, these IDs cannot be used to search for minutes.<n>So we need to late like, maybe unintelligible assured that guidelines who avoid those kind of ehm, those kind of minutes, and those kind of -.3 underlying data sets as the 3 test sets without much training data provided to the participants .<n>For AMI, ICSI we can easily provide the existing training data as the training data .<n>For [ORGANIZATION2] I don't think that the annotator who would be doing this alignment, could cover substantial number of these meetings .We should look at the the transcripts automatically.
It would be better to download it all and align it fully automatically and provided as the training data.<n>Can we download that data and will make um, like unintelligible> then as the test set training to the participants, or we just say that here are the links you need to download and then test?Use the search function to find minutes of meetings held in the past five years .<n>Search for the date, based on the date, and and the title .(PERSON6) [PERSON7] wrote me today and he was planning to to call me tomorrow.
To discuss something, and he is working on a fix now on consense.<n> [PERSON8] propose to divide it into 3 parts like short meetings and long meetings.
So should we really take all of them like data and participants made choose divide them themselves.We need to redo the data set that was downloaded for the OHDS .<n>We need to find and download the pairs of transcript and the minutes for all the sessions that are there .<n>We already saw a minutes they are not variable.
They are not good, they are not variable for us.<n>And the discussion discussion about this, they are not variable.
They are some form of minutes.<n>So I thought that you were one of the people like proponents.
One of the people who prefers to have other data sets in the share task.<n>One of the people who prefers to have other data sets in the(PERSON1) My big worry is that the existing minutes, which we agree are not very good are still the best ones possible for the sessions.<n>I think that the content is simply boring that no one will come up with better minutes.<n> (PERSON6) Problem we decided to take the whole [ORGAN2] corpus and to pack with existing minutes, invest money in alignment and kind of programming an end in that direction and published it as a separate.We should have another, summarization corpus .<n>One of the assignment would be is do the summarization .<n>All task should run probably across all the data sets .We need to find the person who is familiar with Wget, and who can download and prepare the corpus .<n>So please talk to [PERSON] as well, because, he has like as I said he is on vacation this week .In this tutorial, we will create a new session and convert it to a unintelligible> file .<n>We will convert the bullets to the non standard thing that we have as standard .[PERSON6], have you seen the TEITOK presentation by [PERSON5] or or what is his name.<n>The remote colleague of [ORGANIZATION1] who is developing TEITOK.<n>He has been on the Czech parliament browser, and he definitely has a great experience with XML for preserving the original data.<n>But it's it's like if you ask him he will probably come up with an overkill solution.We should stick to the XML format that we already have .<n>This information should be only converted to angle brackets instead of square brackets .<n>The format is not a zero question, as I understand now .[PERSON7] has uploaded fast, but only in English for the moment.<n>It seems to be larger problem for him to work with Czech data.<n>We wanted even to work Czech data.
But it is a pity to avoid that, because it's better data than English.
So he will join us tomorrow and we can ask him.<n>So is that seems reasonable than maybe [PERSON7] another option is that [PERSON8] downloads the data.
And then me and [PERSON8] will start the processing the conversion, and then [PERSON8] would finish that.[PERSON8] please processes this, organize it, according to the dates and the names of the sessions.<n> [PERSON9] please processes this, organize it, according to the dates and the names of the sessions.<n> [PERSON10] please processes this, organize it, according to the dates and the names of the sessions.This video explains how to download the sticker data from the [ORGANIZATION2] web .<n>The first step is to download the sticker data from the name folder .<n>The next step is to download the corresponding minutes for each of the transcripts .In the doctorate? (PERSON6) I have sent you also there and I have sent you the link.
You could download everything.<n>The first the first is our sources.
But they are a kind of very slowly downloaded.<n>This is the source so that can be used for other purposes as well like to process it.(PERSON8) Okay, okay, okay, okay.
So yeah, we will see tomorrow.<n>And [PERSON7] will join us tomorrow.
