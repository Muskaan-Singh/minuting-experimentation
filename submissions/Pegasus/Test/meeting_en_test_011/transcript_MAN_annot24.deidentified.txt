(PERSON9) I just think that you are always the host.
So when we will be going - (PERSON12) to [LOCATION1] - (PERSON12) Yes.
Yes, I will be the host.
In this sense I'm a very good host, you will see.<n> (PERSON9) Well, I'm actually looking forward to when you come.
You and [PERSON4] that's really - Eh well, ehm at this moment it doesn't have even any sense, because we also don't go to to the office.
But as far as it will beFind the proper nouns the names that we want to change, and then we replace them in both English and Czech meetings .<n>Run named entity recognition model on the English meetings .<n>Find the proper nouns the names that we want to change, and then we replace them in both English and Czech meetings .Czech names are pronounced the same as English names .<n>Names can be transferable from English meetings to Czech ones .The total number of names is (wrap??) this menu two thousand and one or two hundred.<n>The name of the speeker is defind here.
I guess we have to remove all of them.<n>Keep the information if the name of the speaker is the same.
But unintelligible> name somehow.We have to create a map that maps these letters - (PERSON12) parallel_speech> (PERSON7) to the real names .<n>The only thing that could be re-speech re-speech eh, possibly kept is [PERSON15] .There is not possible that any proper noun end with dash .<n>Another possibility is a mistake in dashes .<n> Remove them from our proper nouns .unintelligible> /unintelligible> /unintelligible> /unintelligible> /unintelligible> /unintelligible> /unintelligible> /unintelligible> /unintelligible> /unintelligible> /unintelligible> /unintelligible> /unintelligible            (PERSON15) parallel_speech>.<n> (PERSON7) parallel_speech>.Annotators should have something like interface.
They will not do it in - (PERSON15)<n>They should add a letter at the beginning, which says, like name, not a name, eh so name, word, and question mark.<n>And then that means that what they label with the question mark that will come on to them in the Xml format, or in the more complicated format for the individual instances.<n>And then they will decide for the for the instances.(PERSON12) Mhm.
(PERSON15) which, should I share the screen with you- You know what I'm talking about.<n> (PERSON12) And eh [PERSON7] doesn't know about our name tag, so he asked about Czech and eh named entity recognition eh.<n> (PERSON15) I wouldn't bother about Sunday, Tuesday?<n> (PERSON15) I wouldn't bother about Sunday, Tuesday.
This is harder.
So, uh, uh, how do I exit full screen, and then a chat.
So uh, uh, how do I exit full screen(PERSON15) Instead of careful reading of name tag manual and and the named entities eh, yes, if you find a table which list the named entity types, send it to these annotators.<n>It should be processed through copy paste thing by name tag.<n>And what named tag already recognizes as geographical entity, let's trust name tag.In the first phase separately name tag will pre-annotate this list .<n>What name tag doesn't recognize here, give that to the annotators they will be assigning the name tag classes .<n>What is not a named entity that will, uh, be labeled in the whole corpus as a not a named entity .In this example, the name of a suspected named entity is marked as a grey word .<n>The annotator will look at it and the annotator should think or MOG, can that be a name yes or no.
So the annotator will look at it and the annotator should think or MOG, can that be a name yes or no.<n>In this example, the name of a suspected named entity is marked as a grey word .<n>The annotator will look at it and the annotator should think or MOG, can that be a name yes or no.We wanted to discuss in the transcripts diarizations.<n>The name of the - (PERSON15) parallel_speech> Mhm.<n>So in in brackets OB in brackets KI and OB is mostly you.<n>And if to - Eh, eh how to anonymize it means A, B, C, D unify all of them.speaker, ID equals and then in eh quotes the the anonymized version of [PERSON15].<n> speaker, ID equals and then in eh quotes the the anonymized version of [PERSON15].<n> speaker, ID equals and then in eh quotes the the anonymized version of [PERSON15].<n> speaker, ID equals and then in eh quotes the the anonymized version of [PERSON15].All these Changs are misunderstandings in the transcript .<n>Even if it's instead of a corpus there will be some person's name .<n>PERSON18 is starting his Phd.
Which is on speech recognition .He can also stay in the student dormes, and uh, and eh if he'll have more like focus for his studies in [LOCATION1] then eh in Slovakia .Two of us will work as annotators in a sense that we'll read the meetings .<n>And then we have to - two of us will work as annotators in a sense that we'll read the meetings .<n>And then the evaluators will evaluate them like using the procedure the manual procedure and will produce the scores .(PERSON9) [PERSON12]? I will - (PERSON12) I think you already did it.<n>But also choose the number of meetings and eh send us the minutes.<n> [PERSON4 has already prepared some evaluation form, we will discuss it and we will evaluate them.<n> [PERSON15] said that he spoke with you about this last week.
And he wanted it done within this week.
And he wanted it done within this week.<n> [PERSON12] so I want to ask [PERSON12], so why do we like again do the minutes since the minutes are alreadyOne minu- one meeting is about one hour long .<n>One annotator needs a week to prepare a transcript and a minu- nad minutes .
