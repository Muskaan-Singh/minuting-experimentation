I don't know if I need to maybe write dummy ASR worker unintelligible> test sentences or something like that.The KT translation platform is very heavily unintelligible> specific use case that we're using it in .<n>It is meant to be run with the continuous input stream .<n>This week we work together with [PERSON12] and [PERSON5], in order to find better workarounds .(PERSON10) For, for training MT unintelligible> we would need it for analysis of evaluation.<n> (PERSON14) No, so, actually there are main priority now, is to have the online mode working.
So also [PERSON1] needs to test machine translation by looking at the output of the online ASR.<n> (PERSON12] send unintelligible> audio files to [PERSON1] and [PERSON1] did the ASR offline.
But that would be like the way to to get the transcriptions.Learn how to test the all integration unintelligible> .Machine translation quality not affected by mismatching segmentation between the training mode and the operation mode .<n>ORGANization5 have already connected together online ASR and machine translation system trained independently .Chat is filling up with messages but no ASR worker being available .<n>The chat is filling up with these messages but no ASR worker being available .segmentation worker shares a lot of the code with MT worker and therefore will probably have the same problem as the text client for the MT worker .<n>They don't work, they don't work with CTM, but only only in sequence with first ASR and then segmentation .<n>Because of the bug to ship the CTM output which you will have, you can record from some previous session .After session is completed the client has send all of it stuff, recieved all of its output, stop sending anything.<n>But the worker still believes it's part of a session.
Um, and therefore does not accept and is registered as such in the mediator.<n>This happens with both the old mediator in unintelligible> in Java, they happen for unintelligible> as well for the ASR worker, right.The system is unintelligible> we actually have to unintelligible> (PERSON14)<n>The segmentation worker is is sequence as I understand.
Is a sequence labeling-other_noise>Labels each word with either opf insert coma or insert the full stop.(PERSON9) Sorry.
(PERSON9) I'm not able to check it right now, since log has been over written by something else.<n>When the, when the mediator dies, their worker should survive and reconnect again.<n>There will be session, session with SLT, so if you unintelligible> need to discuss this online, than it's good unintelligible> from this improved pipeline .Presentation platform will receive all those streams .<n>Main stream dies for some reason, we still have, we will still have subtitles even if are not the the preferable ones .<n>We need to make sure that that subtitles in Romanian are based on the machine translation all the target languages at once .Presentation platform will recieve for example, the German but I told based on English source or and based on for example unintelligible> or English- (PERSON14) English too.Re-speaker one would continue to be translated .<n>I would also prefer the presentation platform to have access to all the Spanish .<n>But I 'm not sure that the presentation allows to to choose them on the fly .Can there be more people monitoring the same presentation platform at the same time?<n>One would be checking the Spanish outputs, and one would be checking the Dutch outputs, and one re-checking the German ones, and they would like simultaneously make their decisions.(PERSON9) Well, I don-We could do other things, we could, there is I know of a company, because [PERSON] mentioned that.
Like a friend of hers has various tools to support subtitling and also transcribing of speech, manual transcribing.<n>And they also have unintelligible>.
So is like a little little bar of letters and you can send the this the text to that.
So in that way, we would have a multiple of those and that would that would work.
