other_noise> (PERSON4) unintelligible>.<n>laugh> (PERSON7) Is, is not a problem, the, the, but only that the righ-, right (tester) speakers like, eh - (PERSON7)?another_language?> (PERSON6)<n>?another_language?> (PERSON6)<n>?another_language?> (PERSON6)laugh> (PERSON4) I also have some visualisation - ?another_language?> laugh> (PERSON7) The conclusion, conclusions.<n>laugh> (PERSON4) So, yeah, we still dont know whether to restructure it somewhere to have only one chapter .We have only two weeks on to the deadline but its not much.<n>I dont know whether we - I would like to had the book more or less written on, at the end of June.<n>I dont plan to submit anything to (calling)<n>Because I, I would like to submit the, the paper to [PROJECT11] and the paper we havent - we sent to ACL.
But then we, um, withdraw it because the reviews were not, reviews were not very, very good and we havent managed to resubmit it to any other conference so maybe.(PERSON6) What do you mean by second week?<n> (PERSON4) I, I meant, I meant thirteenth to nineteenth.
Because I will be here, so just thirteenth to nineteenth.<n>On sixteenth I should be - go away and be away for the rest of the week.
So, I should be here on the thirteenth and fourteenth.
So, so, so, actually, well only be here on the thirteenth.
laugh> (PERSON6) And the week after? Twenty to twenty-six? (PERSON6) Or [PERSON7], you plan to be here?(PERSON6) Thirteenth would be (perfect)<n>The next Tuesdays will, there will be the meetings.<n>The third, the next week of, of - So, the first week of July there is no meeting or?(PERSON6) So, there is (calling) deadline but nobody submits anything.<n> (PERSON3) I think we need to s-, or, or wh-, what, what's actually the d-d-dead-, deadline for? I think we need several deadlines.<n> (PERSON4) So, so I think the results is that, that we have now wont lead into something publishable in two weeks.
So, well probably not submitting anything.The official deadline for the book was the end of June but I think now that its .<n>The end of January.
So, I dont know how long, um, will take, um, the, the reviews and all the, all the things which I planned for half of ye-, half of year.
Um, after the submission.
Maybe it will be faster, maybe not.
But, anyway, um, I would like to submit it like officially the end of July.
Because I dont know whether it can be postponed many more.We could definitely say that we were not able to attend conferences because they were cancelled .<n>But I dont know whether we can say we cannot, we couldnt write the book .<n>For the book we shouldn't ask for the extension but for the conferences it would make sense to, to use it for some conferences next year .(PERSON6) Um, stop adding new contents and comments.<n> (PERSON3) Um, stop a-, stop adding comments.<n> (PERSON3) Hm.
(PERSON4) Machine translation and the, like the heat maps were, were very sharp but I know if someone else generates something very similar the heat maps are .unintelligible> try more param-, changing the parameters and see different heat maps and .<n>unintelligible> try more param-, changing the parameters and see different heat maps and .<n>unintelligible> try more param-, changing the parameters and see different heat maps and .(PERSON3) Well, you can just add a footnote commenting that, that, it might be an artifact of [PROJECT9] because, because one unintelligible> the heat maps look slightly different.<n> (PERSON4) I think it mostly comes from like concentration of the distribution because in [PROJECT2], [PROJECT2] also something like balustrades so this like straight lines but still the distribution is not so focused.The book now is one hundred and thirty pages something .<n>There are many, many details at - Yeah, maybe it, it, its better - Because anyway now the, now the, um, the book now is one hundred and thirty pages something .I don't know, the last week rather.
And I think it's almost ready to be read.
But not quite.<n>I came to the conclusion that this chapter really, the, the old idea of having a story is not really doable for me because I don't know that much of the history and I would have to spend another half a year reading things.<n>And I don't think I will be writing very much about, um, the generative, the new generative language models because like they are based on sub-words and the embeddings are not interesting anymore.This is the overview of where my chapter is going .<n>I have a few questions about data, but I think it will be easier to .<n>Write them on Slack and we will discuss it there because I have to run anyway .laugh> (PERSON6) So, the things that are there should stay where they are, already and I, I need to add more, um, things somewhere.<n>Titles of sections and basically the things that are there mostly should stay there or be made shorter maybe or rewritten a bit but kind of the contents thats there should be mostly there.<n>There is some things missing which are not there yet.
So, the introduction, I have to change the whole thing basically because its just some left over stuff from the previous introduction which rely on some stuff that we moved to other chapters, so"Who is better", is, is, is, is a very bad title of the section .<n>"Who is better", is, is, is, is a very bad title of the section .<n>"This is something we want to change so I plan to, um, just say what's true and then just say who found it"So that is says what is there, not, not the structure of the papers .<n>I'm not really sure about the division here so I have a section which is now called "Semantics"Morphology is usually the first layers and then syntax is the deep layer, deeper layers or and so on.<n>(PERSON3) Hm.
(PERSON6) Um, just its (typic) problem.
And thats all for the, um, abstractions that people look for, kind of.<n>Maybe I'll find something else which will get its own subsection but, um, then there a few more.
So, um, one is which is in which layers.
Um, um, I don't want unintelligible>.(PERSON3) Hm.
([PERSON6]f) I dont know.
Um, yeah, so I think this should be like maybe two pages, now its one paragraph.<n> (PERSON3) Hm.
([PERSON6]f) I dont know.
Um, yeah, so I think this should be like maybe two pages, now its one paragraph.We want to put the multilinguality paper that we submitted to - (PERSON4)<n>I don't know if anybody, um, wants to take over this section .<n>I don't even know if we want to put it into this chapter .First, the first chapter is, is, is taken from my, from my dissertation .<n>Next, it should be reasonably easy to, to add the missing information there and, to organize it into a readable way .(PERSON6) (Just a) quite, quite unintelligible> (PERSON1)<n> (PERSON3) (Yeah, no time for pictures), but I dont know whether I can that, (turn it in, in Overleaf)<n> (PERSON6) Hm.
(PERSON1) So mostly language models and machine translation.
And actually, all of those results are from RNNs.(PERSON6) Hm.
(PERSON1)<n>(PERSON3) Hm.
(PERSON1)<n>(PERSON4) I think these figures could be included in, into our visualisations .unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible> unintelligible>(PERSON4) So, see you next week and - (PERSON3) Hm.
(PERSON4) Um, yeah, we should, we should discuss everything like, um, actually, in like during the, during the week so that we update it.<n>And, OK, so we have like only - Yeah, we have only, yeah, yeah.
We have just two weeks.
OK.
So, bye, bye, [PERSON3], and see you later.
