From this Monday we can actually go out even if it's not like the necessity .<n>From June we are allowed to reach our family.
If it's in the same region .<n>If you are in the city then you have to somehow get to the forest .There will be at least one more, uh, in May.
One in May and one in June, and -.<n>We have we will have eh couple of deliverables due in June.
So for these six up coming once you can basically start working on them.<n>We haven't decided who will be our internal review person for any of them.(PERSON6) Okay, I'm gonna last review the summarization.
But generally, there ASR also interesting for me.<n> (PERSON6) So I don't know, who should we the summarization review eh.
Then that's another-.<n> (PERSON15) Okay, I would be happy to do the review unintelligible>.(PERSON6) So who wants who wants to read a fairy tale.<n> (PERSON6) I'm much rather read about ASR systems.<n> (PERSON1) I could, you know, I could say we have to if it's not many words.There must be some project management guide from previous project .<n> QT21 doesn't seem to have this.
They have this period reports and data management plans but not the project management guides .Internal reviews should be ready by mid June at the latest .<n>The first draft, yes, but complete draft .<n>There is one more milestone, the Congress .The year 2 test set will be due in the end of August .<n>It's many documents, uh, and depending on the availablity of the document .<n>Sometimes it's also ASR test set.
So, sometimes that just runs quick .The test sets consists of these raw documents, curated to serve well, linebay, segmented, everything .<n>The actual set of documents that you will test against will depend on the set of languages that you want to test .We are trying to have documents, but sometimes it is the line oriented .<n>And ideally, there would be automatic checks so that the everybody could check out this repository and run these checks .<n>And also it would automatically be able to create the file lists .This defines just the data and not the evaluation metric .<n>It would do automatical downloaded and it would put the commit ID the current commit ID into the fingerprint .This is geared towards the evaluation of spoken language translation .<n>The SLTF, ideally would be the sacrebleu for spoken English translation .<n>The primary evaluation will be the translation quality, and the ASR and translation quality regardless the delaying .This is exactly what we did for these for desirability to tasks it .<n>People still can misinterpret what time stamps should they use .<n>The only way to to do the comparison really fairly is to run the models or a serve the model .The forced alignment, which finds the words in the in the sound is not reliable for us either .<n>It seems that finding and curating is half the price when we pay what we pay to our annotators normally compared to like the professional translation .I prefer to find people who actually speak them, and I preferred them to find the related data sets .<n>Then indeed, we will ask the people to find these text monolingually and translated maybe back to Czech .Irish is equally equal priority with as other languages .<n>Let's get this grow.
And if we test with these test sets then it will be very easy to do the deliverable for August .<n>Maybe let's wait with the answer until I tell you whatever we know about this .[PERSON4] has reminded us off BBC guidelines and standards for subtitling, which we are aware off, but they are not reflected in our systems in in any way.<n>Better captioning or as spoken text translation ehm on screen will make better translation and readability, recomposing sentence on the fly my (ethic liability)Some will prefer this some will prefer that uh - (PERSON1) Should be do this at the end or should be do this a bit sooner?<n>It's entirely possible that retranslation go back a lot with the transition to end-to-end ASR .We will have our new generation of eh models previously based .<n>unintelligible> transformers finally in direct translator .<n>Even extending could still lead flickering the MT it's like you listen to German .unintelligible> will be trouble for us .<n>Like the system, even guess is what people are gonna to say, and translates sooner .<n>We are trying to run GPT tool to predict the tail of the sentence .There is no way to touch up on these topics before the demo .<n>We learn about unintelligible> quit couple of proposal in the unintelligible>.<n>And also propose what you prefer to demo because there is .What should be the material that we are that we are subtitling?<n>What should be the material that we are that we are subtitling?<n>What should be the material that we are that we are subtitling?unintelligible> we have new models now as well.<n>What so far in our experiments what kills the performance for the final user of the machine translation is the sentence segmentation .<n>Maybe if the primer language would be German, because [ORGAN2] has good models for this.<n>From German into English and from English into all the languages, TEDx talk .(PERSON6) Sorry for not managing the the half an hour.
But as you see, my kids are really getting hungry, and i still need to peel the potatoes, and -.<n>laugh> Thanks for joining, and will be in very close touch for for the demo in the coming days.
