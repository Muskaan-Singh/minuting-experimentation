We should probably - If you really go down and probe you should probably use more than this .The attention and compution scores would interesting in the sense that in their unintelligible> 60 internet use emm try to use sentences and test on harder, weirder like constructions to see introduction like emm for like still means that would unintelligible> some basic characteristic.[PERSON7] Okay, so you can start with something like this.<n> [PERSON7] Yeah, I mean functors not for means.<n> [PERSON7] Yeah, we saw we haven't we have connected, we want to we want to have a skype call that we need.<n>It will be managed to you to know what we need will do here and so that you can contribute or I don't know.<n>But we haven't so far we haven't organized this call so we've do first create organized call here with the leader here of this group.[PERSON10] unintelligible> for use for black box .<n>[PERSON7] On the on the zero on the first layer the there are the attention looks on the previous on the next token .[PERSON7] You mean like the shorter phrases can be in like (balustrades) but like different (balustrades) in different heads?<n> [PERSON5] Okay.
Actually I only focuse on those heads that's for instance was quite good at finding subjects eem the verb.<n>There is one higher (balustrades) there.
Eeh, but actually it was only heads balustrades difference than have mix from cognition and (balustrades)I wanted to try extract the graph structures how how was like similar syntactic trees or different types of trees we can (extract) from syntax .<n>The syntax relations can improve eehm, eeh, machine translations .Simmilar asks [PERSON3] about two heads that are trained to be similar to a that attentions in these heads, attention to the syntactic unintelligible>, syntactic (precedence) or syntactic .<n>They train it together so they don't need the syntax annotation when translating so it's it's learnt.
Because it's an objective function.<n>They added that two heads must be similar to the gold trees.
So the trees are needed only in training and in tact in the there.[PERSON10] Uhm uhm uhm.<n> [PERSON5] And this is more unintelligible> to uhm uhm.<n> [PERSON10] Uhm uhm uhm.multilingual [PROJECT2] language model or you can be a model payed person possibly task and then he could think okay, so, for doing machine translation it be into syntax or maybe it's useless the syntax.<n> transformer trained for machine translation would be more syntactic and [PROJECT2] less syntactic.
Well, we can - But models get different result but it's hard to say okay.Layer analyse small layers so easier to find unintelligible> that unintelligible><n>Training model it's just most train some unintelligible> and the stuff like that .<n> PCP seems to be unintelligible> working on picture form .[PERSON5] Is this your master thesis? You're ready? [PERSON3] Well, I mean, I analyse to some many unintelligible>.<n> [PERSON10] I can always submit it lenght tomorrow.
Yeah, there is not - Okay.
I don't know the unintelligible> deadline is delay just possible date so the video unintelligible>.
