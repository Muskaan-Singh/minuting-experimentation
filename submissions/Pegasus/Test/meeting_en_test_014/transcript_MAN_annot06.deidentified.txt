When it actually runs the requests to the mediator ten times, or whether the mediator receives a multi like a Multi Channel, or or multi path request.[PERSON13] has tried to launch those and it failed, because there is not enough ASR workers .<n>There are no available ASR.
And at this point there are three, so probably three ASR crashed from the seven and were released .Is there text only pipeline available?<n>The problem is that when when we see we send to whole text file at once.<n>And we have to wait for the segmenter to process it but in this case unintelligible> not at once, so it could work.Six German, six English workers available .<n>They are in admin web as as idle.
And available here .<n>They are only register was the platform or the mediator, but they are not actually operation .<n>They are only register was the platform or the mediator, but they are not actually operation .We have failed to stream the slides, both from my notebook and my desktop .<n>My notebook is behind a firewall, and it failed for unknown error, which is probably the firewall .<n>So this is in the Google document I'm curious what the setup should be so that we stream the uh, the slides .unintelligible>="192.168"<n>unintelligible>="192.168"<n>unintelligible>="192.168"<n>unintelligible>="192.168"[PERSON13] notebook is capable of choosing the English sound .<n>It will be impossible at the moment to descriminate which English is coming from which microphone .[PERSON13] can simply run the EB client twice, one of those who will have connect to the English presentation, using the the round table sound.
And the other one will use one of the respeakers.<n>It is totally out of of control, and its unintelligible> so out of control for presentation platform the presentation platform will simply you display different.<n>It has no way to see which the English is which it will simply anyone who connects as little as a worker providing English will be displayed there.One thing that I noticed when the subtitling was somewhat working was that there was a lot of repetition .<n>It was like two different text messages interchanging, or a select appearing one after another in loop on in the subtitles field .<n>This is probably the reason why you see unintelligible>uncomplete .unintelligible> part, you just want to see the exactly what the.<n>(PERSON11) I think that probably the the segmenter worker is preparing phrases for the machine translation.
So that probably would succeed.The risk is that there is no end of sentence in the original speech .<n>The translations wont fit into that into that small window .<n>The segmentation worker from the ASR does have access to the continuous stream .(PERSON13) So could there be some delay with the information about the availability of two workers, so that when you run?<n> (PERSON12) So that he have not like unintelligible> up to date information about the availability of the workers.<n>When you will switch to German or to Czech, unintelligible> tell us because maybe you can see something which is not what you expect.We are going to configure te presenation platform, English as the top priority source language since we are running test with English .<n>German as top priority and so on, because otherwise we'll not be published i- on the front end the subtitle .Would you be available for this, for all the coming days?<n>I want to be there as much as possible and to restart the workers unintelligible> as possible, but i can not guarantee that unintelligible> here at every minute.(PERSON6) unintelligible> has to go and like control C and start new .<n>We have the system that works okay this way, I would prefer to find unintelligible> the workers not resetting this so much more .How do you tell a dead worker from a working worker?<n>The point is that the point in the code.
Where the worker knows its session ID.This tutorial shows how to use docker to kill a mediator .<n> docker kills mediator when it knows the session ID of the worker .<n> docker kills mediator when it knows the session ID of the worker .SSH unintelligible> are open port there.
So 22 4443 and 4444 are opened there.<n>unintelligible> might be getting your SSH access.
And unintelligible> but restarting the other workers.<n>At least one of which I think is not accessible .I like you would see a message in the slak window, restart session ID and you would just run your own script restart session ID .<n>It would do the grapping and it would do the killing and it would do the restarting .<n>Both are failed to resolve so they, even the name the host name is not available .
