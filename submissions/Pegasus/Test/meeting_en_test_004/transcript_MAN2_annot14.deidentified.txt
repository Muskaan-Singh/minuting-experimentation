(PERSON9) Hello, can you hear me, is it doing anything?<n> (PERSON9) Hello, can you hear me, is it doing anything?<n> (PERSON9) Please test- test German worker and [PERSON1] can at the same time start third window, right?We have only one English segmenter.
So we can run only two unintelligible> at once.<n>It's seems that we are short of German interpreters.
So the German signal will be available only like for 20 minutes, and then 20 minute break and 20 minutes again.<n>The good thing about German ASR is that we don't rely on the German, on the English segmentation worker so that that could run as well.unintelligible> getting the end of one sentence in the beginning of the next, and we not read it preparefull that, and I think that's something that we need to talk to [ORGANIZATION] they can fix that and make sure that they're not getting these overlapped to two sentences but that's a tranlastions starts.<n>All that input starts with the new sentence.<n>unintelligible> getting the end of one sentence in the beginning of the next, and we not read it preparefull that, and I think that's something that we need to talkThe Pexip full motion icon has hidden away .<n>When you are following the the screen presented by [PERSON1], [PERSON1] are you still presenting the screen?<n>The issue is that when you are following the the screen presented by [PERSON1], [PERSON1] are you still presenting the screen?In Pexip screensharing, you see an update only every two seconds .<n>PERSON12 can not hear what we are saying.
So that's big-other speech="">I don't hear [PERSON12] .<n>PERSON7 can not hear what we are saying.
So that's big-other speech="">I don't hear [PERSON12] .We are getting the same request multiple times, sometimes four five times the same input.
Right now it's fine, but it's a bit waste the speciality, to have couple minute languages.<n>There should be minimum cashing like, never send-other speech=""> (PERSON4)I'm trying to figure out something to manage it for the June eh fair-The June meeting .<n>I perfectly understand that it's it's not eh-It is not comfortable to translate multiple times the same ASR out .empty worker could save the uh, the graphics card, or whatever the CP use, time and could cash it .<n>But I think the cashing is useful even if eh even if there is genuine repetition .The German ASR was working while ago, and [PERSON1] has one of the workers for himself.
So we are following two channels uh, I'm talking to the English channel.<n>And we also have the second mike, and that is intended for that's intended for German speakers here like.
So one of the German worker is used by us.
So one of the German worker is used by us.unintelligible> platform URL.
Okay.
I can't share these right now, because it's up and running.
But maybe it is better if I share my screen with you .<n>unintelligible> English, French, Italian and German.<n>unintelligible> more than two, or or mo- or less or non-subtitle .(PERSON9) Can we get the source code of this web page .<n> (PERSON7) Is there any way that we could ship the data to it?<n> (PERSON7) [PERSON1] has the workers running and if you are following [PERSON1]'s screen as well, I don't know if [PERSON1]'s start sharing, and if you click the HD button which you may have or may not have .[PERSON1] notebook initiating the session .<n>So sending the audio and your presentation platform showing the subtitles corresponding to that .(PERSON7) unintelligible> I suggest to try the English one.
(PERSON9)<n>It's seems that in the in my Windows laptop it isn't displayed anything even if I run it- Even if I run it in Chrome, but on my Linux desktop it work's well.(PERSON9) we have one Linux machine with- Does anyone have a Linux machine with Google Chrome?<n> (PERSON9) Ok, don't worry, at some point it will work, I'm going to- * (PERSON9) Ok.<n>Talk about it with the team.<n> (PERSON4) unintelligible> in the document is that I said I'm not quite understand the logic in the ASR, because it's giving us sentences in unintelligible> fragments .We are starting and nine with the preparations.
And then at ten we expect everyone who is available to join.<n>And hopefully all the workers will be running.
And we'll.<n>Next Friday should be available and I should be available to join unintelligible> Pexip, anyway.It's probably not an issue of some rule based coding, but if it is, then it will be great to to know this .<n>It's like streaming for me, but not for everybody.
It's not like broadcasting .<n>The play should be only play and pause, but no way of jumping in time .unintelligible> of course you have to be registered, let's say to the system as administrator .<n>The configuration page where you are able to set the unintelligible> and the stream provided for each language .Is there a URL so that I would just type slash admin or something like that to force it to go to the admin screen?<n>I'm able to display it on my desktop, but I'm not able to- (PERSON9) You cannot share it.
(PERSON7) in Pexip, but it's- I can, maybe I can provide you a snapshot.
laughing> Could be a solution,let me- (PERSON9) So is there a URL so that I would just type slash admin or something like that to force it to go to the admin screen?Slack is an open source software that lets teams chat online .<n>Slack lets teams chat in any language.<n>Slack lets teams chat in any language.<n>Slack lets teams chat in any language.<n>Slack lets teams chat in any language.<n>Slack lets teams chat in any language.<n>Slack lets teams chat in any language.<n>Slack lets teams chat in any language.We have admin web so we can see which workers are running and which fingerprints are they using.<n>But we should have the map anyway.<n>If there is a worker connected to the mediator, there is no way for us to change it's fingerprints.<n>It registers with some particular fingerprints and these need to be compatible to this surrounding workers.Can anyone access the fingerprints map drawing now?<n>Can you put all the fingerprints of the languages that the presentation platform responds you next to he object that I just created?unintelligible> Idea is to add just a minus pub to language- (PERSON9)<n>unintelligible> It's simply too stupid.
I pasted into the [PERSON7]'s, yeah.
So we need CSCZ pub, so [PERSON7] is there any update on the presentation platform necessary to accept more fingerprints?unintelligible> .<n>The worker emits the Spanish Spain pub fingerprint .<n>The only way you can do it is use the same unintelligible> (PERSON9)(PERSON9) I'm not sure if I'm, I'm sharing the screen, I'll share my camera instead.
I'll stop sharing my screen, how do I, stop that.<n> (PERSON9) I'll stop sharing my screen but [PERSON12] show this.
So this is what the participants are eventually are going to see.
So the full screen is not sufficiant default screen, that's the question.(PERSON9) So [PERSON12] could hit as eleven or twelve- (PERSON7)<n>It would be better to have it optimized for being vertical, because then you have space for the subtitles.<n>It's more important to have it optimized for the desktop rather than for the mobile phone.For the desktops it would be better to to have the subt- the video larger .<n>It seems it works for the cellphone very well that it adapts to the size of the screen .<n>The problem is to let still the subtitle to be displayed .We could launch ourselves and the only thing it will be doing would be showing the text in terminal window .<n>Could send back the published subtitles so that you can catch the subtitle directly from the the client running .<n>If it could register itself twice, once by pro- offering the dash pub thing, and that would be only copying thing exactly .In general I suggest you to forget about the presentation platform till Monday .<n>When it will be sufficiently stable it will be deployed on asure .(PERSON7) Bye.
(PERSON9), thank you, bye bye.
