(PERSONm): I'll try to share my screen, because I was given the presentation options, so probably you see my screen now?<n> (PERSONm): Okay, so eh for today, we have this eh small call and the news is, eh, are there any news from [ORGANIZATION7] about the status?<n> (PERSONm): I am not sure either but I hope, that there will be a resistent answer soon.
I was tasked to prepare the exact questions we are asking so I hope that's on track, but [PERSON2]: I'm(PERSONm): For the real use case, like not remote, eh but eh, we are still probably undecided how are we going to ship the translations to the participants .<n>The text to speech doesn't provide any (prozaic) information, so that's the (PERSON2): The text to speech doesn't provide any information more than that .In the plenary session, there is the single speech given by the speaker, and then possibly some questions .<n>We'll try to connect to the (interpretors) eh and eh and eh transcribe their voices, and or directly the main one eh and then eh, this will be shipping the subtitles to somewhere .(PERSONm): In the first year, we should have at least one dry-run workshop, eh which is like actually a complete test, but it's still before the main [ORGANIZATION5] congress.<n> (PERSONm): In the second year, there definitely should be the main congress, and then eh maybe one more in the same second year, or eh like two in the third year.(PERSON3): We have only a vague idea that, of course, something will be happening the year after the congress, but what and how many is not decided yet.<n> (PERSONm): The congress with the plenary sessions is something too to show off, but the eh the workshops are eh, like more practical, I would say.Integration work package eh is the one that makes sure that everything runs .<n>Work package 7 dissemination helps to promote the project and its results at these events .<n>Work package 4 dissemination helps to promote the project and its results at these events .(PERSON2): We have been competing for the [OTHER4 parliament, and we reach the accuracy up to ninety eight percent of accuracy .<n> (PERSONm): It is considered the most accurate [OTHER4 speech recognition system, so it's (PERSONm): Okay, yeah.<n> (PERSONm): So we probably do not need any specific need from [ORGANIZATION7] on this, but still, maybe ask around and or mention, that in the project, there is this partner, who has the best [OTHER4 recognition in the world, so that there is the chance toHow many hours per speaker do we need to be able to adapt to them?<n>Speaker adaptation is done essentially how you described, usually.<n>23:29 The number of hours depends on the ASR system.parallel_talk> it doesn't really work eh /parallel_talk> .<n>The adaptation starts from an already existing acoustic model for the language .We will try to create our own, but we are still starting with this .<n>We should not need any recordings for the baseline acoustic model for [OTHER1](PERSONm): So then, each of you once like, you have indicated, that on that type of language and the type of a speaker, we'll see how many person months it creates .<n>This is only for us to see how much how many person months do we have to have in in work package 1 on the data .(PERSONm): I will make a rough estimation as soon as possible, obviously.<n> (PERSONm): So this so the idea where this belongs eh the thanks for unintelligible> that this belongs exactly to this sheet tool .<n> (PERSONm): And the total numbers, the eh subtitles per partner, then get automatically copied to this first sheet so you'll see how that balances the overall budget .(PERSONm): So the last bit is the missing text parts, and eh here, i think that it's probably more efficient, if we just say goodbye and everybody will spend the remaining fifteen minutes in writing and writing and writing.<n> (PERSONm): Okay, so the last bit is the missing text parts, and eh here, i think that it's probably more efficient, if we just say goodbye and everybody will spend the remaining fifteen minutes in writing and writing.(PERSONm): So, task 6.1 is the integration of ASR (essential) from multiple partners into the [ORGANIZATION3]'s platform .<n> (PERSONm): So, the involvements in terms of first months will vary, but everybody should eh be there .<n> (PERSONm): I don't know how much you want to eh delve into minuting yourself or how much (causes) you want to delve into minuting .(PERSON1): Well, we did a (few) prototypes.<n> (PERSON1): In fact, those were small reports, to be said well, this is a prototype, just how you install it, this is the number of languages covered here's what it stands for, ehm.<n> (PERSONm): And there g- will be deliverables related to those, and I like the idea of having a few months between the software and the report and the integration, so eh, sorry, for the integration work package, work package number 6, there is also this like compact block of eh, of(PERSONm): So, will just either [PERSON2] or myself will just review that.<n> (PERSONm): The more you do, the better, because the more reliable the estimates are.<n> (PERSONm): So, if you start a [ORGANIZATION2] doc, separate one then I'll, I'm happy to do the merging of the text into the Overleaf.<n> (PERSONm): Okay, so I think that's it for now, let's indeed eh close the call, unless there's any other questions from my side.
