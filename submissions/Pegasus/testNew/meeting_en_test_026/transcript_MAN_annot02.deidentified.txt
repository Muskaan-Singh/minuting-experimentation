[PERSON1]: I'm stuck with those experiments, because I had notable problems with how to run it at all with explayable mistakes .<n> [PERSON2]: It is it is to complete the GPU test and and to know that one version, one new version of [PROJECT3] really, really works .<n> [PERSON3]: I started running those experiments that [PERSON2] told me a while ago .We don't have much progress with multi-source because we first need the data .<n>The all the corpora that we are collecting are document level if we can have them like that .<n>We could have done the multi-source research also in the text domain .[PERSON10] is already hopefully in touch with, uh, everybody, uh, who is getting some of the [PERSON10]'s original tasks .<n> [PERSON17] and [PERSON4] will synchronize about the tools that [PERSON10] has developed .[PERSON17] disappeared at the moment.
laugh> So, [PERSON4] Uh, not exactly but I'll probably be in touch with [PERSON10] or some sometimes early next week.<n> [PERSON1] Yes, so the sooner the better.
Because, ah, like he will be leaving and, ah, ah, it's, yeah, things will only get harder.<n>When working with [PERSON17] and when, when, ah, like documenting what the set ups are, ah, make sure that it is tested wellIt's important to first debugg it using the lock files, and then it's important to debugg it in the pipeline .<n>We have seen during the last sessions that the new ASR, the end to end ASR, E2E ASR, also suffers from the spasm issues .<n>The profanity filtering should really be, ah, employed twice on each path .[PERSON] saw that I think, for a second ah, the ah the incoming, ah, sentences were like flooded with lots of oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
And then they disappeared again.[PERSON10] has probably started, but he should walk you through that thing.
So that you can do it yourself next time.<n>And the last bit is the multi-accent English.
Ah, so the English, which is robust to the various speakers.<n>The current idea that that better is is working on is that he will create new sentences by concatenating words that were spoken in other sentences.<n>So, it will be really multi speaker, ah, sentences and, ah, therefore, the robustness to the different accents of these speakers could be also improved.In a talk yesterday, I heard another idea.
It was like during the training.
Ah, they were dropping out, ah, a time bands and frequency bands from the sound.
So they were training on disruptive inputs, and that also greatly improved the robusteness of the system.[PERSON1], you were during that time you're in some different lecture or, ah, because at some point I suddenly saw that like [PERSON17] stopped trying, maybe.<n> [PERSON5], you were during that time you're in some different lecture or, ah, because at some point I suddenly saw that like [PERSON17] stopped trying, maybe.(PERSON1) But when the workers started running, it didn't work.<n> (PERSON4) Hm, maybe it's because of second.
Or have you seen the common addresses file to include [PERSON14]'s ah army worker.<n> (PERSON5) No we have a separate directory for that.Is it better to run the multi lingual moral with fewer languages enabled?<n>Is it better to run the multi lingual moral with fewer languages enabled?<n>Is it better to run the multi lingual moral with fewer languages enabled?There are maybe like forty languages, so so there are forty, like the big size is forty .<n>For back size for it, it is actually a lot slower than for back size eight .<n>We should be able to launch rainbow worker from [PERSON9 on our cluster .I'll see what errors are those, and -.<n>(PERSON1) Get in touch get in touch with [PERSON3] and others.<n>And let's use this mailing list for these technical issues like getting [PROJECT3] running.(PERSON1) So, use whatever a communication platform works for you.
Like direct emailing is fine as well.<n>If you have if you ran- random questions, ask around.
Never wait.<n> (PERSON8) So, I would like to hear from [PERSON8] quick report.<n> (PERSON8) So, you just need to come up with a reasonable estimate how much more you need.
So there they do have space, they only give it away only like after.How much space is available on Troja?<n>Command DF will tell you the the space on all the disk .<n>PERSON23 would like you to be participating as well .(PERSON1) To apply for PHD one deadline is very soon.
It's the end of the year.<n>We are way beyond planned time.
That's because we haven't had the call last week, unfortunatelly.
So, I'm now highlighting the experience, ah, from the [ORGANIZATION7] and as you want again.<n>I've already reminded everybody to record what you saw and also read what other has other have experience.
But let's also discuss the the lessons that we learned.(PERSON1) Okay, so you're really like caught in the in the hospital, right?<n> (PERSON4) Ehm, I was raised like very late in the night around nine, nine thirty Indian time.
So, I have started finishing that today.
By the end of the day, I'll be done with it.This week's session focuses on managing people around the globe .<n>PERSON7 knows where these things should be stored .<n>When there is some session happening, we really need to make sure that we have the important people around the globe .Non native accent is very critical .<n>Names, ah, and terminology for sessions need to be created manually .<n>Data crunching needed before dictionaries can be used .[PERSON6], because he is doing how to work with [PROJECT2].<n>Can you confirm that you are a hundred percent sure that the dictionary is well included.<n>What I'm considering is to have an independent keyword spotting, ah, from sound.[PERSON6] -.
P P ah, [PERSON6].
And, is there any update from the potential, ah, ah, colleague or friend of yours.<n> [PERSON8] -.

P P ah, [PERSON6].
And, is there any update from the potential, ah, ah, colleague or friend of yours.We could use neural networks to filter out profanity .<n>We could use sentiment analysis to remove words with a negative sentiment .<n>But it doesn't play well .There was actually a cable competition for this, where people had to make models to detect the tweets or like sentences which were harmful in some ways .<n>What we are after is more like sentiment inconsistency rather than bad sentiment .We can just say in the filter part, they can just look out for a hateful comments or profanity or hateful sentence, and we can simply remove it .<n>It will be like a sentence was said.
But it's not irritated actually transcribed, we will have it in our logs, but it won't be displayed on the subtitling platforms .Please read the experience of others, record your experience from the most recent sessions .<n>Let's discuss them next, ah, ah, next week as well .(PERSON5) Thank you, Bye, bye.<n> (PERSON2) Bye.
