(PERSON1) Hi, hello.
Can you hear me? (PERSON2) Yes.<n> (PERSON1) I don't hear anyone.
I have to reconnect again.
Or maybe can someone else, give it a try as well.<n> (PERSON4) Okay, so you want to hear, what did I do? (PERSON1) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So the transcripts for check are al- almost done.<n>And uh one uh one transcriber of Germany is working.
(PERSON1) Mhm.
(PERSON4) And she wants to do it alone until December the tenth.(PERSON1) Okay.
(PERSON4) So we can uh get her feedback.
And and continue with that.<n> (PERSON5) So so uh I have just added the transcripts for the first 30 parts.
And for the next ten parts, it's still running.<n> (PERSON5) Mhm.
(PERSON1) Uh so if you uh [PERSON5] had the time uh obviously, there is no way we could do it for the next week.
But we should really have these systems ready for the upcoming sessions- (PERSON5) Mhm.In this video, we show how to use speech recognition techniques to shorten words .<n>The video was filmed in Edinburgh, Scotland .<n>In the video, we show how to use the speech recognition techniques to shorten words .[PERSON6] should uh just like, click, uhm other_yawn> click on to s- s- s- some buttons .<n>Get the uh uh get the uh, uh vocabulary.
And get the uh uh get the uh, uh vocabulary.In the afternoon, for example, in the Czech afternoon, you are able to do something .<n>The more tests we do, the better .<n>Without domain adaptation, it would be useful test .Two presentations will be set up at the same time for two concurrent sessions .<n>One will follow the other's video .<n>The pipeline will be probably the very same .Use uh uh two separate uh pipelines.
Uh but each running actually the same thing.<n>Each of the pipelines uh on Monday for the two different domain adaptations.This video explains the problems of converting file formats .<n>Use the video to help students with reading comprehension and vocabulary .<n>Today's video is part of a series on reading comprehension and vocabulary .We must not rely on [PERSON11] because he is organizing some event tomorrow and over the weekend .<n>As soon as you have any numbers, please send them to me .<n>Just regardless how low or high the numbers are, this just receiving the numbers will be a big relief for me .[PERSON6], are you taking uh a part in that call, uh, with [PERSON11] as well?<n>(PERSON1) Because you should also evaluate.<n>(PERSON1) So I'm I'm hoping that you will be able to have uh the multiple uh custom dictionaries in the ASR system.<n>(PERSON6) And so the performance of dix- (description) was exactly the same with the without adding these pronunciations in their dictionaries.unintelligible> is assumed that unintelligible> should contain our (words)<n>unintelligible> can be used by developing for some model .<n>Take only the words that were observed five times .You need to figure out what words are in the uh in the language model .<n>And the words which are in the language model should be simply copied .<n>And there will be multiple lines with different phoneme variations .<n>And there will be, again, the same grapheme form .Is it possible to enrich the language modal by texts?<n>Is it possible to enrich the language modal by texts?[PERSON7], how much time do you have in the coming days?<n> [PERSON1], how much time do you have in the coming days?<n> [PERSON7], how much time do you have in the coming days?(PERSON7) Well, [PERSON7] I'll send you uh a text on Slack later.
(PERSON3) Well, [PERSON7] I'll send you uh a text on Slack later.<n> (PERSON4) Why do w- What do you want to compare?<n> (PERSON3) Uh uh actually mostly about uh the error rates uh in machine translation.
And the (ASR)<n> (PERSON4) Yes.
I think we have only one option for ASR, don't we? Only one ASR worker, or there are two?Mohammed compared the scores between, I think, uh it was (rainbow) and there (summer) set of workers.
(And set up a rainbow workers about better.)<n>Basically how what [PERSON1] mentioned on the call that there was two unintelligible> individual translation workers, you can see if they are performing better.If you want to inspect it, then l- listen to the source audio .<n>The annotator will ca- ca- can filter them out .How many worker- workers can I run in parallel on (cpu)?<n>How much time do you have to work on the German ASR?(PERSON2) Well uhm.
And one more thing.<n>My (ASR) is uh uh lower case.
Is it okay for you?<n> (PERSON2) Okay.
And without punctuation also.This is the unintelligible> dictionary.
And it is is actually in our public format .<n>There is a package of our language which automatically converts the (IP) to unintelligible> the other way .There is some uhm nice chart y- in Wikipedia that um shows you the nearest phonemes.
It would be the one.<n>There are s- (PERSON6) Are you are you typing (in this chat)?<n>Because I'm still seeing your uh common line.(PERSON6) unintelligible> I don't know the uh a pronunciation of any of these vowels.<n>There should be some examples.
For example, uhm.
For the uh open (meat) the first uh first IPA phoneme.
If if you click on it, then, for example, it's in uh (bat)(PERSON6) I'm as sure I am unintelligible> the main adaptation models.<n> (PERSON6) I'm saying that if you could just change these (IPAs) to the alphabet phonemes.<n> (PERSON6) Okay, so, so.m (PERSON6) Thank you so much.
