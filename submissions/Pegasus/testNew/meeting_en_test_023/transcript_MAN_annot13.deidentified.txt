(PERSON3) I'm really worried about [PERSON5] if he can actually help us or not.
Because, I, uh, then I I'm really worried about [PERSON5] if he can actually help us or not.<n> [PERSON1] was about to join because he told me that he wants to be in the meeting.
Because there are some decision points from his end.<n> (PERSON1) So what, what we have to discuss today? I reviewed the webpage.
Uh, uh, and I don't know if you have highlighted the portions of the document with theAnnotator stopped or [PERSON5] has stopped.
Who, who- (PERSON1)<n>Annotator stopped, okay, so, uh, so if you, see, if it is an online document- If you see that the annotator has stopped-.<n>The agenda is in the master document so if you can check the Coffee Meetings.(PERSON1) So collect, uh, candidates for, uh, unintelligible> Annotate at word type level .<n>This is in full documents if, uh, that particular instance is an NE is not ,uh, an NE, and then insert token level annotations .<n>This is in full documents if, uh, that particular instance is an NE is not ,uh, an NE, and then insert token level annotations .(PERSON1) Okay, he doesn't want to rename it.
Uh, if it is agreed, then-.<n>PERSON1 Okay, so the idea, uh, is, at the end we need to have the full collection of all our documents with all named entities replaced by place holders.<n>The process of the named entity removal has to be very clean, and we have to know at what stage of the process we are.A word type is the word as it appears in the dictionary .<n>A word token is a particular instance of the word in a running text in in the running text .There are a lot of typos .<n>Most of the output is not a named entity .<n> Eighty percent is not a named entity .<n>Open problems, uh, and one of the open problems is the edition of new documents .How do we ensure nothing leaks into the final data?<n>How do we ensure no NE leaks into the final data.<n>It would be better also to preserve the identity of project names or or whatever.We should not ignore utterance labels for speakers when they are referred to in the text .<n>We might afford tracing, uh, other people who are only mentioned .<n>We don't have to discuss whether this is the same Jane or different Jane .We need to de-identify this.<n>What is the imput and what should look like?<n>What is the de-identification guidelines.<n>And potentially some new concerns will be added, like after [PERSON2] discusses this with [PERSON7].She needs to read the regulations.
That will take her some time .<n>She has to decide what should be actually anonymised .<n> align the transcript with the minutes .The key word indeed is the personal data .<n>All person's data must be removed .<n>The data set needs to be free of personal data .Two consent forms should be created for each meeting .<n>The first form is for the permission to work with the data .<n>The second form is for the permission to publish the data .Consent form should be simple and easy to fill out .<n>People should be given access to the full dataset .<n>People should be given permission to publish the data .In this tutorial, we will show how to extract the names of participants from meeting minutes .<n>We will use an annotator to correct any errors in the data .<n>We will then use the data in the form of a web page .We extract the name of participants from each of the minutes .<n>When we are sending the people again the links, every gaze to that gives us an opportunity to spot other things that should have been anonymised .<n>We create the individualized sheets- (PERSON1) unintelligible> (PERSON3)(PERSON1) We should have a sample document, uh, one meeting or two meetings at most.
Ideally, uh, at the end of January.
So that we can put it online as to the prospective participants of the task at the beginning of February.<n> (PERSON1) Two months for us are good and then one month for them to answer.
So they would-.I think that [PERSON2] will be finished with the work type level annotation, uh, well, in two days .<n>This should not happen later than in mid February .<n>The only thing I'm not sure I don't like this changing very quickly .Master students should not be invited to the Scientific Committee .<n>It is a very special task to look through these people .<n>Some of them have some Google, some Google, [ORGANIZATION6]'s or something .For this work better, the more personal we write it, the better .<n>I suggest that we divide the people.
Uh, so that we invite them personally, if possible .I don't expect anyone to be in any good position for, uh, serving on this.<n>I suggest that for the sake of time, let's finish the call now.<n>And on this list of people to contact.<n>And let's aim for the deadline that you suggested in two days from now.unintelligible> (PERSON1)<n>unintelligible> (PERSON1)<n>unintelligible> (PERSON1)<n>unintelligible> (PERSON1)(PERSON1) I have privilege because they have points for cooperating with foreigners and I'm not a foreigner enough.<n> (PERSON2) cooperating with all this foreigners.<n> (PERSON1) I think it's be better, I think it's better in English.
