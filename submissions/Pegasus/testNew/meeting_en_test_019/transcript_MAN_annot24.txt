Matus Zilinec will give a brief summary of what he has been working on for the past months .<n>The goal is to synchronize the group, and the date and time .<n>So the day and time of the week is chosen, so that it is fits to most of us .We will be anonymizing these calls, so we ll be removing names, replacing names with placeholders and replacing project names with placeholders .<n>After this we ll ask you again eh, to give us a permission to uh, to use this in the uh, for the sum- meeting summarization purposes .I was using the rainbow model for paraphrasing for, for Michal Novak.<n>Since then I haven t actually been working on so much.<n>There have been some things since I didn t have really uh, so many instructions.Google has released a data and a model for mining parallel data in 100 different languages .<n>The data is not English-centric, but between all of those uh, English languages .<n>The models are very tricky to run, because you need like for GPU with sixteen gigabytes of RAM at least .<n>It takes like up to a minutes to translate just one hundred sentences .Ebrahim Ansari is overseeing the development of the SLTF .<n>Daniel Suchy who has worked on the ELITR test set will join us only from December .The name is Khan Academy for SLTEV.
And also only that files are created in another documents.<n>The ELITR test set contains the input texts and references and also input sounds and reference transcripts.<n>So please, everybody get in touch with Ebrahim directly, and get it s- Like eh, like find a way in which this tool will work for all of you.Please make sure to evaluate any systems using SLTEV on ELITR test set .<n>Download the ELITR test set when you ask for that .Rishu is lost because one of his lectures is scheduled so I m attending lecture as well as the the meeting .<n>The most urgent thing to do is getting the evaluation of the of all the systems .Rishu is like uh, putting together, and also what eh, eh what Vojtch Srdecny would be kind of doing .<n>The goal of this censorship tool is to allow to immediately hide the outputs and then show them again .Bohdan has worked on multi-target machine translation for his master thesis.<n>Now he eh, is also partly part-time employed on ELITR to develop multi source eh, models.Peter Polak and Umar Faru are working on multilingual ASR systems .<n>Their model is only for offline processing .Umar also please, train as a comparin- compa- comparison in using the exact same training data, exact of evaluation you two please be t- in touch together.Umar: I m trying to chop the the utterences to words.<n>What I m trying to do is to chop the the utterences and recreate new sentences using eh using the words itself .<n>We can leverage more eh, non-native speakers, as we can reuse more frequently the words eh, spoken by non-natives .Ondrej explains how to train LMNT unintelligible> in English ASR .<n>On the the data set also contains information about age and gender .<n>And we can try to synthetize eh, using the existing words this new data sets .(U) I would just confused that what he is actually waiting from - He was something mentioning about the comparing the performance of your system with something unintelligible><n>So was he talking about the this multi-lingual ASR or was he talking of multi-lingual ASR?<n> (P) Okay, okay.
I think I need need to work on whatever he was thinking about so I will just maybe first to unintelligible> the path of data from unintelligible>.<n>And unintelligible> to evaluate the ASR.
So I need just eh,We train the set and we test it.
And this unintelligible> will be Kaldi again or same model unintelligible>
