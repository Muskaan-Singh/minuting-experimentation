(M) [PERSON7] did send ah, that TDID for keyboard extractor .<n> [PERSON29] has today written to us that this he has some TDID based on summarize .<n> [PERSON7] sent me to discuss with both of you that how these results came for that .Most commonly occurring words in meeting data are unintelligible><n>unintelligible> occurs because meetings are not set up like meetings are played .<n>unintelligible> is one of the biggest drawback of meeting data which needs to be handled someway .<n>unintelligible> after one month, so if you say January 15 by February 15 we should know if we are accepted in unintelligible> or not .Signal itself is earlier interspeech, so I think its very risky or.<n>If we cannot get the benefit of being integral part being in their proceedings then I would prefer interspeech uh unintelligible>Empty marathons used to have system or tool papers that were published as a special issue [PROJECT11] that was in the first year when that happened .<n>Authors were invited to submit for another review for for the next [PROJECT11] issue .<n>What I 'm worried is that the timing of sick dial is equally bad as the interspeech special session .Sick dial 2021 is already in June right?
