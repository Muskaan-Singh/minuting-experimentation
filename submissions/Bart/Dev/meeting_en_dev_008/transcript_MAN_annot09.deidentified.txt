 Peers can use the [ORGANIZATION2] link to connect to all coffee meetings .
Peers will also be able to use the same link for the next time they meet .
"It's not going to be (PERSON5) free for one hour, but I'm not sure if it's a good option for the rest of the time" "We have (the paid for) the paid for it, but it's not (a) good enough to be used for the other part of the day" An annotator listens to the audio, and also goes to the automatic speech – <ehm> speech transcript .
He or she corrects the transcript based on (how they understand) it .
The annotator creates the minutes, yes.
But mostly – it – this is what was created by [PERSON5] within our [PROJECT2] minutes .
Not all the meetings has the original minutes, right? But on the other hand they contain real names and they don't have errors in – <ehm> in the content .
We try to get original minutes from the minu- meeting organisers, but sometimes they may be very short .
It deleted the team, but after <unintelligible> – "We agreed that they will keep communicating with you in the same way and that <unrecognisable_speech> will manage (log it up) – "PERSON4" The agenda was brought to a meeting with a group of members of the [ORGANIZATION2] team .
The meeting was called 'organization2' and 'organisation2' Proposal is a manual measure for <ehm> automatic (minority) measure .
Meeting or coming up with that measure want to be that much busy .
(PERSON5) There are many automatic measures for (summarisation) But <unrecognisable_speech> none of them works as [PERSON3] realised .
(Person3) <mm> None of them really works well, I would say that they are kind of deceptive in some cases like they tch- they are very high – very high <unintelligible> – with the human score .
Human evaluation in nature language (generation) is done that way .
Human evaluation is subjective, but still I would believe that it is subjective .
If we don't come up with the alignment based manual evaluation measure, we will do as the other (energy) task <unintelligible> entries, right? Proposal should be (like very strong), and whatever we say shoould have a ground – grounded (this is to that) Proposal is not very clear, and we have plan B as our backup .
The format is stable <unintelligible> - but you can put them with <ehm> – with a (label) in your <unrecognisable_speech) brackets .
(PERSON6) Yes, meta-data and dashes, dashes is important .
For the GateHub it's only pushes, I <unintelligible> do it, I do it .
For each annotator I have to change the name form (zac)1, from [ANNOTATOR2] to annot2 – and before pushing, before pushing to Gatehub .
But before that I also have to keep the names – this final names of the files recognisable .
(PERSON6) So, let's meet today, [PERSON4], let's met today in person? (I'm really worried about this team that he's proposing, so, perhaps it's better to set up another meeting, like today or tomorrow, or maybe Friday .
(Person4) "I disagree with [Person5] about several things, so we nedd to discuss <unintelligible>.
(I think) everything is almost sorted," says Person .
There are decission points, decisions points has to take, so yeah.
We cannot really discuss anything without [PERSON5].
There is nothing to discuss today anymore.
