So welcome, I told [PERSON5] so that in-, include, join our, um, [PROJECT2], um, project, um, because currently he is working on survey about, um, about getting sim card, <unintelligible> sim card, eh, from transformers, from <unintelligible> neural network so this, um, this is connected our book.
And these one section is i-, you could write the-, these one section for, for my attentions and he can, he can talk with [PERSON8] so that he could, you could have in this, because he is working, um, he i-, he´s survey, survey would be about, um, the probing, um, the syntactic probing of [PERSON1], [PERSON6] and <unintelligible> papers.
So I, if, if you agree so I would, I would, I would end.
So, um, maybe I, I can talk it about, about section o attentions and maybe we, we can talk it trough.
[PERSON13] Yeah, I, I have one more paper whitch was not accepted to ACL, um, I, I was working on that in [LOCATION4] and, um, the results are not, um, not very good so maybe I could, I could, I could, um, push it to, push the paper to the, to the [PROJECT8]-, [PROJECT8] so that´s, it´s somewhere.
It could be black box paper as well, so yeah, I, I will decide and I will talk to, with <unintelligible> on [LOCATION4] <unintelligible>, they would like to have this paper in, in [PROJECT8].
[PERSON13] The next deadline is, the deadlines are in the, um, two, two jurnals <unintelligible> and one dedline as on like January and the other is June.
[PERSON13] But, but I think that the, the paper, the [LOCATION4] paper could, could go there to the <unintelligible> so, so problem we can, we can do it to Archive and [PROJECT8] so that someone can read it.
But I´m really starting to getting to it and also I am done with teaching this semester so I will just work on the book from nowone so -
[PERSON8] Yeah, so I managed to, to start working so maybe the mainly I was doing what [PERSON10] was doing so getting back to work but, um, I, I was restructuring the, the chapter so it´s lot of mess, um, but I started adding some information from some papers that, that was, was not there yet.
And, yeah, so now I´m trying to structure the <unintelligible>, yeah, to all the, um, modules chaptures some morfology so what they say, what morfology is captured and how will it is captured and there is no big difference between the individual models so, um.
Then, um, I want go into in so much details about the models and some of the information I have there has to be like merged together and, and restructured and, and some information has to be added so I´m working on it.
[PERSON8] So, so in notable models there is now a bit of rubbish because there is something that I just moved from my chapture but they were not finished even when they were in my chapture and now they moved to different chapture so it will see <unintelligible>.
[PERSON4] Just before the meeting I, I, I pushed, I pushed somethind and, and that´s like a first half of the chapture and, and the second half I probably use something of, of what you copy there and delete work so just half you, you had from the chapture probably so <unintelligible>.
Yeah, I will to <unintelligible> to some preface, I think it looks nice.
Right, yeah, I write some, some figures from our, from our paper but till I´ve no, I did, I did the attention head into many, many like many templates, or not templates, many styles like attending to the same position, attending to the adjustement position but they are no styles nonvertical, mix style there is something vertical and are balustrades which are, which only appears in, in nation, um, in a [PROJECT6] but it should be there and the block which, um, li-, like two, two squares in the, in the visualisation with, whitch mainly are, um, in [PROJECT3].
And but I have only some of the visualisation because only, only some of there were in our experiment with [PERSON8] so I will need to, to generate, um, to get the, get the same or the similar metrices from the, um, from the [PROJECT3] as well so I, I´m planning to, um, to -
[PERSON13] Yeah, it should, maybe the color should be changed because it would be better to have it like the <unintelligible> to be white to that the lines are visible there, um, so let the I will changed it and I will (regenerated) maybe more, more to the on [PROJECT3] as well so could be can compared, um, better.
And I would like to, this is, this is, um, figure about, um, how different types of heads, um, the type propotion in a blue, blue task but this is copied from, from my paper by covered up but I would like to have similar, um, similar, um, graphs for, um, for, for [PROJECT6] and other thigs as well so I, I would like work about days and -
So this is about like different attention head types in, in transformers like in, mainly in [PROJECT6] and in [PROJECT3] and on and, um, then it should continue by the section with, um, getting syntax from, from the self attention heads or getting syntax, yeah, getting syn-, syntax from self attention heads and then that is something could [PERSON5] is going to write in his survey as well.
[PERSON8] <unintelligible> in better states probably [PERSON5] can now work with you on the attentions because my chapture is, is a real nice so I think it would be hard to introducing you <unintelligible> now.
For now we can work with [PERSON5] with, um, these, um, lend getting syntax from attention metrices only, from attention heads and yeah, I if only some, some papers and some notes to each of the paper when there are, there were doing something like something grated.
And yeah, so this is, this is how to get like the relations and then I have a section about really inference of syntax trees based on the, based on the attention.
So on these two chapt-, um, sections I would work with [PERSON5] and yeah, there, yeah, about two papers or maybe more papers about highly head-, <unintelligible> attention heads which is still missing and then, um, some papers about that att-, attention heads are not interpretable on why, there are not or why it should be interpretable.
So I haven´t continue with this, this week so but I would like to finish it somehow, maybe I will, yeah...
I think that, um, but you already went trough this, um, somehow trough this, um, types of attention heads, so I, I, I have changed it somehow, there are very small text and I added the figures it, it is -
Yeah, it is cohere but it´s the missing the end like the discussion at the end of this, um, of this, um, paragraph at least and some pictures are missing still.
[PERSON13] Yeah, I could also sen-, um, let you know when, when this is the, this, um, the, this section is finished so that you can read it.
I, I still dream that we could have it somehow at the end of at June in some share <unintelligible> which is readable and we passed it to the reviewers.
Um, but, yeah, maybe I don´t ask someone if, if you can, if we don´t manage it by, by the end of June what we should do but, um, I don´t want to do it now because when we know that the deadline is postponed we will not do anything so, um -
[PERSON13] And about that we have to talk with, I will, I will, I will write to, to [PERSON7] to -
I, I already talk with him and he said that, yeah, we will do it somehow and we will find someone, someone, somebody but, um, -
[PERSON13] But I would, if to, if the survey´s really goog I think it could be better to send it to better, better place, better, better, better conference then black box, then [PROJECT4].
[PERSON13] So if you, if you resend it from [PROJECT7] to black box you trough had the reveiw-, the, the reviews there.
[PERSON13] So that make it, make it faster or if it is, yeah, if it was very good on [PROJECT7] but not accepted, the, the accepted like August automatically to black box.
[PERSON13] To, um, submited for [PROJECT4] because [PROJECT4] is only, um, like it´s a conference like that I don´t know what people <unintelligible> will be, um, um, like it will be all from, from all the fields of informatics so maybe they will not understand much of <unintelligible> much discussed if you this, this <unintelligible>.
[PERSON13] They´re writing about so it´s only if you want to go to [LOCATION7] and it´s the other <unintelligible> have but I don´t know maybe it will be virtualised as well so -
And, and definitely you can, you can withdraw so they say, yeah, if you cross submit you must withdraw before submitting <unintelligible> diversion and <unintelligible> you <unintelligible> is all this twelwe.
[PERSON13] So, so let, let´s write it somehow and you will see and written how the paper is written some nice thing so that we could submitted to like other place than [PROJECT4], black box.
[PERSON5] For now I think I will try to [PROJECT4] and, and then <unintelligible> from to, to send where and...
So yeah, there, there are to, there will be problem when somebody left in, in our grant so I will need to use it.
I will need to go trough, trough all the mails I´ve, I´ve get from [ORGANIZATION3] and see what I can do with the, with this money but we can buy something on equipement or I, I -
[PERSON13] So we will be, we can, we can move, transfering money to the, um, um, the salaries but we all, but I don´t know where you can introducing you, um, new people to our project.
[PERSON13] I could, I could, but we, we have always like the survey like (sixtate) 60000 so <unintelligible> like for -
So I think half of it the salary you get and half of the salary just typicall the <unintelligible> of the Ph.D. money so...
So in this case maybe for [PERSON5] it would be best if you concentrate the money you can give him to as little time as possible because it is some ceilings so -
[PERSON13] I, I will need to, yeah, go trough the, the papers and see what is, what is possible.
[PERSON4] What, what [PERSON7] computers it was, um, it was a strange situation because he got a confirmation from, um,[PERSON11] cluster is no, not able to accomodate more [OTHER1] at that time so, so he bought a laptop what, what the strong [OTHER1] that, that was to the region he was allowed to, to buy it from [ORGANIZATION2].
[PERSON13] But anyway if he, if he will pay for, um, all the, the <unintelligible> for [PROJECT7] or for black boxes to, to we will not end up with much more -
[PERSON8] Yeah, we got a mail from [PERSON7] that we can come to the official event, um, um, like I really not all of us but we can come.
