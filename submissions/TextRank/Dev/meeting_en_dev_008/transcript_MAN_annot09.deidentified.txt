(PERSON5) No, no, this is the same link you can find in the – if you have accepted <ehm> that <ehm> meeting invite, it is the same link.
It is the – it is the (rolling) [ORGANIZATION2] link, we can use it <ehm> like for – for all (of our meetings), so – (PERSON6) Yes, okay, nice.
(PERSON6) <mmhm> <mmhm> (PERSON5) So, I – I wanted (to note) that – <ehm> so, (I didn't know) <unintelligible> – it was like – (I don't think there is) <unrecognisable_speech> there is the – <ehm> everything I <unintelligible> clean manually corrected transcript as well as <unintelligible>.
(PERSON6) If I <ehm> – if we look at it together and I will just <ehm> detailise some things that you want to know <ehm> – so <ehm>, <ehm> I will send you a link to minutes annotation, so that you can open it now.
(PERSON6) (One more) thing is – is that they want to make it <ehm> – so that – so we sh- we have to pay for it beginning (till) next month or so.
<ehm> So – (PERSON5) But [ORGANIZATION2] meet is also free for fourty minutes, but I want to <unintelligible> [PERSON6], how like <ehm> [PERSON5] <ehm> like (be have got like the paid for <unintelligible> [ORGANIZATION2]).
So when you send that – so <unrecognisable_speech> so what the annotator does is that he or she listens to the audio, and also goes to the automatic speech – <ehm> speech transcript.
<ehm> And the documents <ehm> contain original agenda of the meeting, which was created by [PERSON5] or [PERSON2] before the meeting and partially <ehm> s- <unintelligible> extended during the meetings, or sometimes after the meeting.
(PERSON5) Okay, so I would like to ask you now – So, by this original meetings, what <unintelligible> [PERSON5] and [PERSON2] (has) created, so it is just for (reference of the annotators).
(PERSON6) <ehm> Yes, <ehm> we try to get original minutes from the minu- meeting organisers, but sometimes <ehm> it may be very short for example, for – Some group of meetings, for example for [PROJECT1], <ehm> the minutes are very very short and they contain just one line ([PROJECT1] book).
<ehm> So I still kind of – so at the moment I do not have any idea hw to technically work with the variant that annotators send the data via (GateHub).
<ehm> But at the moment I'm not ready to say how it should be organised, because I have to give them <ehm> tasks <ehm> s- I have to say them 'Now you <ehm> write this and that – this meeting' <ehm>, I have to correct it, so I have to look if their transcript and the minutes are <ehm> okay.
(PERSON6) Yes, but after <unintelligible> – (PERSON4) But I think we – I think we agreed that they will keep communicating with you in the same way and that <unintelligible> will manage (log it up) – (PERSON6) Well, well – (PERSON4) <unintelligible> what you will – (PERSON6) [PERSON4], not really, because afterwards, after that meeting, he said me many times h- that he still s- sees that it should be maybe changed.
(PERSON6) Probably (we should) – (PERSON4) So, [PERSON6] – (PERSON6) Not exclude this option for the moment, <ehm> but – (PERSON4) Okay, so, [PERSON6], I – yeah I – so – so this is like you <unrecognisable_speech> to upload the minute <unintelligible> correct, so this is actually a (list) work for us.
(PERSON4) Like if the annotators up- upload the minute themselves, so – (PERSON6) Actually I'm not really fine with that at the moment, because for me – <ehm> I should think it over and I didn't do it yet.
So I would also (gain) <ehm> – say that <ehm> I prefer this – the same strategy that you're using, <unintelligible> sending the data – (PERSON6) So probably let's – yes.
(PERSON5) So, <unrecognisable_speech> [PERSON6], so <ehm> – so <ehm> – let – [PERSON4] said in the morning – I also like – to some extent I thought and I – I think I also believe to some extent – so – <ehm> <unintelligible> we have an actually manual evaluation <unintelligible>.
I – I need the al- I – understood we need the alignment, but <ehm> I was talk <unintelligible>, so we must have a measure or a <unintelligible> by which we can use the alignment to produce something.
I'm not sure <ehm> – first I'm not sure that I understand what you ask and second I'm not sure  – I'm not sure I can answer.
So this is what – <ehm> if you would ask [PERSON5] this question he would probably say that <ehm> <unintelligible> think about it and <ehm> make o <ehm> or invent the measure or metric for – for that.
So I've like – I – I would pick up from this (here), so the thing is that <ehm> meeting or coming up with that measure want to be that much busy.
Because <ehm> if we <ehm> like – I don't want a <unintelligible> that – suppose we say about – (PERSON6) Sorry, sorry, I lost the u- lost the idea.
So the options that we have is – we have the transcript, which is manually corrected, we have the minute, which is the <unintelligible>,  contains the <unintelligible> summary.
So, we need the na- next try human evaluation, (decides) them, we compute them, but we add the number of human evaluation, so that we can <ehm> be sure that we have good  quality.
I – I – I got – I go- got the (multimission) of <ehm> the <unintelligible> meeting script, but still that is like the <unintelligible> that [PERSON5] <ehm> is targetting to achieve <ehm> would you be more objective?
<typing> <unrecognisable_speech> Okay, so, like – Okay, so the thing is that if we don't come up <ehm> with the alignment based manual evaluation <unintelligible>, we will do as the normally the other (energy) task <unintelligible> <ehm> entries, right?
(PERSON5) Yeah, so <parallel_talk> So – <parallel_talk> if we – if we are like – if we are not able to come up with the alignment <ehm>, if we are not able to come up with the alignment based <ehm> manual evaluation measure, – (PERSON4) Yes.
Yes, so <ehm> – so the thing is that <ehm> my <ehm> <unrecognisable_speech> before November it would be difficult to come up with the alignment (this score), so <ehm> for the (past) shared task that we have (way) to propose <unintelligible> speech, I think we should go whatever is available and whatever is (better) to us.
And then maybe we would also like do some research on this and we come with some (beautiful) matrix, and then maybe the second <ehm> – you know the second event <unintelligible> we can come up with this <ehm> new <unintelligible> – new techniques that we want to do.
<unintelligible> so, I now loose – I know there are many autoatic measures for summarisation so if we like just put those <ehm> in the proposal <ehm> (no one we) question?
Yeah, it's how we should do the shared task and – (PERSON6) <ehm> <parallel_talk> Yeah, so – <parallel_task> so, <ehm> what I wanted to discuss <ehm> is probably <ehm> the format of the basic sample trial.
And then I <ehm> – wh- when [PERSON1] appears <ehm> I will discussed – <ehm> discuss with him, if his annotation tool can work with the <unintelligible> samples, and then prepare <ehm> the second <ehm> version of basic samples.
And <ehm>, as for the data format, this is also a point with [PERSON4] <ehm> – (PERSON4) As for the data format I'm already clear, like it's what we discussed like the three – three sections in each (file).
(PERSON4) So this is – I think this is the <ehm> – so it's almost like I said, but you can – I said to remove the meta-data, you can put them with <ehm> – with a (label) in your <unintelligible> brackets – (PERSON6) Yes, meta-data and dashes, dashes is important.
(PERSON4) So it's – it's almost the same, so the format is stable <unintelligible> – (PERSON6) Yes, this is – Well, I think I will have to discuss it with you before I begin once more about some details.
(PERSON4) Yes, sure, because – yes, <unrecognisable_speech> (PERSON6) But, yes yes, but – (PERSON4) But I think this is a – because this way you put all the information, (you put practically put on) all information, because you have the meta-data <unintelligible> the summary.
(PERSON4) I think for this we are okay, but we didn't have time in the morning to discuss about some other details, like <ehm> anonymisation of – anonymi- anonymisation of the names of this annotators.
We need – we need to (encall) them, so you have to prepare a list with their real full names and their annot01, annot02, annot03 and that you have to put in the <ehm> (folders).
And then you will use the zer- annot01 as the name to the folder structure that you – that we have, so you will have to rename the folder structure.
What – <ehm> what – what, like renaming in the structure in the directory or the list, or what do you – (PERSON6) So, now we are <ehm> looki- we are <ehm> kind of <ehm> changing <ehm> the data storage from (Sorbow) to GateHub repository.
What I was saying is that you or I or together we will have to rename the names in the cluster, all the names.
I have to change all the names, so it means, that for each annotator I have to change the name form (zac)1, from [ANNOTATOR2] to annot2 – (PERSON4) Yes.
(PERSON6) Somebody – so – and if I – (PERSON4) Yes, so you create the (file) – you create the (file) the document that – internal – that you have access to, or even a notebook let say, a paper notebook, and you have to keep the – the names of this collaborators or annotators, their full names – (PERSON6) Yes, this is clear.
Because <ehm> I'm not able at the moment, I'm not sure if I can be – if I can make <unintelligible> but I – at the moment it is very complicated for me to anonymise <ehm> all of the files to – so to name general names.
So it may – it should not be the name of the annotator, but it should be some ID that I can <ehm> dete- that I can determine where to put it.
(PERSON4) Yes, I told you, annot01 is like – (PERSON6) Yes, yes, in this case it is a <unintelligible>, so nw my task is to rename the files.
(PERSON4) yes, but before that I also have – I mean, I also propose some other things but you didn't have time to discuss them, so, I'm not sure – (PERSON6) So, let's meet today, [PERSON4], let's meet today in person?
<unintelligible> to <unintelligible> (more) – (PERSON4) [PERSON5] would be – better to have also [PERSON5], I don't know, when he's available now, or tomorrow, or – so maybe it's better to set up another meeting, like today – like one of the day in the morning?
(PERSON5) I think the meeting pass- yeah, the meeting password is minuting, which is already there in the meeting <unintelligible> (PERSON6) Could you – could it – could you please send it to [PERSON3]?
(PERSON4) <ehm> No, I mean I definitely – (with) definitely <unintelligible> with [PERSON5] to – because today we didn't finish, like we left some issues without dicsussing them, so <ehm> – We cannot really discuss anything without [PERSON5], because <ehm> – (PERSON5) Exactly, yeah.
