So the plan is will be [ORGANIZATION2] welcome, will be Mary Sorrow, and in-between will be (Python Sorrow) that's excepts sentences for translation from the [ORGANIZATION2] worker.
So this Python based <unintelligible> which would I do preproccessing and he can handly many, yeah, not so well the logic, where need to be dealing with partial sentences, but -
So a very basic Python based, so to do the preprocessing and received request so yet - for translations forward <unintelligible> and post him back.
So, I think the the there should be almost ready [ORGANIZATION2] worker available.
So I think that next week for example, you should know whether this proof of concept worked, or what do you have running to any issues.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so for partial sentences, I think that they should be treated from the [PROJECT2] prospective as simple simply a different sentences, other sentences that we expected to process.
So this is something that needs to be carefully checked, because timestamps will be later on important for the presentation platform.
and [PERSON7]'s guess uh is that the <unintelligible> worker should work well with timestamps and totaly hide them from the (Python) and [PROJECT2].
So I think that to- like the timestamps should not go to the (Python) server at all,
and the the limitation with this approach is that we can handle only like one single timestamp at the beginning and would be the end of the segment.
So the only timestamps that we have are the beginnig and end of the sentence or <unintelligible>.
And that the basic unit that you send to the presentation platform is called a textfield content.
And at that point the presentation platform would like scroll it up, and it would again start displaying whatever comes as as full textfield.
It will be a replacing the content of the of the textfield with with the new messages.
But the incoming messages must be exactly what we want to be displayed on the uhm on the uhm subtitle.
(PERSON7) But the the scrolling the history of previous texts fields would that be supported?
A new message is a new subtitle to be displayed and it can subtitute the biggest one or update the let's say the button of the textfield in order to let <unintelligible>.
so in other words yes part of the message that the presentation of platform is receiving is an indicator, whether this is an update.
so replace the current field, or this is a new text field move the history up and populate the field with with this new content, right?
I think that we'll arrive at the solution where the timestamp of the beginning would be the critical information.
And as long as the timestamp is the same, the field should be replaced with with the new content.
And if the timestamp is higher than the current the last text field should be like move to the history and and closed.
And we would be displaying the the contents from this timestamp on.
I think the the starting timestamp would be the critical uhm point.
And that was the development schedule for the presentation platform after we have discuss it on Monday.
I know it's realy uhm <laugh> close to our deadline, but this is the only information I have that <unintelligible>.
(PERSON10) Probably the development team <unintelligible> have something close to be fine advertial to use as prototype, but we can have some working maybe for <unintelligible>.
Do we plan to run any [ORGANIZATION3] workers in [LOCATION1], so especially the ASR the ASRs of English and other things as a fall back solution.
We have decided not to use the [ORGANIZATION3] platform today, because we are still checking some of the recording qualities.
So they are able to connect to the [ORGANIZATION2] platform and then the whole chat window is flooded with the messages not enough workers available.
I will have the <unintelligible> and whether we can start I think it maybe ok.
And (it be) can view some no <unintelligible> voice and <unintelligible> somewhere I think it is okay we also <unintelligible> other things.
So so is good that there that many workers now, so I I actually suggest that we try after this c- .
So I would be curious myself to see how that works if the workers are available.
also I have the things I'm <unintelligible> and ehm the things running on the same <unintelligible>
so, yeah, some <unintelligible> we stand when we need more worker I think we have to stop limit number workers.
So in in the long-term, it would be useful to have this image spread out for the various reasons that you mentioned, for the uh workshop itself we should be good.
So I think that we we should be fine relying on, but that's please talk to [PERSON3], what he thinks, because in some early stage we discuss that for just for a backup purposes.
I know that in the call yesterday, with [ORGANIZATION3] the workers worked at the beginning.
I didn't attend the yesterday meeting, but the bug that I mentioning is that sometimes the work, one worker can handle several sessions, but then it's, but then it stocks and it doesn't return any output.
I will <unintelligible> us, but yesterday so yeah I don't know what is happening there, because we <unintelligible> when I do know what <unintelligible>prophones it was able to handling several sessions.
And that <unintelligible> I think it in one sentence it ehm it yeah output <unintelligible> and  I can't <unintelligible>  fancy <unintelligible> call but it <unintelligible> it was in call,
this is a <unintelligible> I think I had to <unintelligible> information and then <unintelligible> maybe I can hopefully I can see the one simply wrong come from-
So that you will maybe set up, maybe maybe there could be a set up support [ORGANIZATION2] mediator, and you would connect only one worker to this mediator <another_yawn> and and
So, so this script is should be like a stress test, and you can put it to the cruise control repository.
And then mo- most importantly you need to run it and figure out where the problem is and then the bucket, but-
If there is anything we can do in order to help you the publing the problem, we stand us careful <unintelligible> the mediator <unintelligible> to test just your worker for some-
It's the same as in the sample and it didn't for for me this week.
And then we already have the the workshop, so is anybody, does anybody know that they are not able to make it to the the uh, since uh, the same time, an hour earlier than today on Fridays?
and if there is more people who though problem, please put it in the in the document here, and we will find a slightly different hour.
