You are preparing the link into the- (PERSON5): Ye, Ye, Ye No, no, I'm just aligning that link of the web interface, which is already there one in the corrector- (PERSON8): So [PERSON4] we have discussed with [PERSON5] your negotation.
(PERSON5): Ye, I am searching I I did hadn't half of the copy of it.
(PERSON4): I did with you [PERSON8] for like I have to collect the minutes so- I don't understand this upload thing.
(PERSON4): Ye, ye, so, the thing is like I'm starting the I'm starting the web that how to croll those minutes.
And how to like find what is actually there in the [ORGANIZATION2] corpus and how we do that link with the web.
(PERSON4): Okay, so from the source like from the transcripts that we have.
Can you just share the screen- (PERSON8): Ye, if you see the gender.
This is the link to the from 9. from 9.
(PERSON8): Ye, so if I follow the link I may open this search for minutes, here's minutes, and here's a search.
And the name could be from if you go to the data, europarl data.
(PERSON4): So it might be in the other range, so the [ORGANIZATION2] script is from 9 to 14 I guess.
I don't know if this website has gotten index of the minutes just like it had for the transcripts.
Because the indexes here, these ones correspond to the court was not the whole [ORGANIZATION2].
So you want to just see that what they are following like the based or is it some kind of the- So they have shown us a snapshot of the interface which they have done for the annotation tool (PERSON8): But what should I do with that?
After the in the after the references you can find that.
The interface we haven't shown it- (PERSON8): Okay (PERSON5): It is the based our it is not by base.
They have just it is not shown the transcript and the summarisation.
(PERSON5): So I'm this is the interface which can be seen in web application.
But they have the for the ratings they have this web application.
(PERSON5): So I and if you see to like after the references can you just go after the references?
So I told you that what i reviewed from the various papers regarding the evaluation.
So I just wanted to show you how how what kind of people- What kind of manually valuation people are performing for the summarisation systems.
And based on the web- There are annotators are asking by scene board the transcript and the summary.
(PERSON5): So I just wanted to confirm that is the web base good for us or something else is is.
I think you just come up with what you consider to be the best.
(PERSON5): So, what I proposed is that we have the transcript and the reference in the interface.
So we build inteface which shows the transcipt and the summarisation.
So the annotators do not have to compute each and- Because there are so many minutes and the ones which are generated.
(PERSON4): So I just want to understand that supposed we have the interface.
And we will have the questions for while which the annotators would.
So do you want to do it for all the data.
So thank you for the prooving details we already <unintelligible> for the testing data.
(PERSON5): Ye, that's that's that's what [PERSON8] and I discussed that for the drafting of each should be finalized.
Okay so I will send the- (PERSON4): So as I underst- Understand so the coherence with the read ability and all these scores.
Ye [PERSON5] please also while you put your criterias please also evaluate two minutes- (PERSON5): Hmm, okay (PERSON4): Okay, so that we can have the same set up of what good and bad minute looks like.
(PERSON8): So you want two different- (PERSON5): Yea two small small minutes so that I can evaluate based on the measures.
(PERSON5): Yea, so it is it is I think a good idea so we can easily finalize the draft (PERSON4): Yes.
(PERSON4): So [PERSON8] I would like to ask like for currently then we are not going ahead with the alignment thing, right?
What are the pr- (PERSON5): So some eval and the one was the another paper <unintelligible>.
So I implemented the all the beginning of the paper.
(PERSON4): Yea, no, I thought the matrix that you that you did.
I'm doing it with our data and not the AMI and the ICSA corpora.
(PERSON5): So I think you also might have done the papers I think.
(PERSON4): Yea, so I think if we can have like the europarl data with the transcript and the minutes align.
And the minutes are also available and if they are- Even automatically extractable it may have sense to extract all the meetings that are available.
So you mean the europarl- Okay, okay so you mean that- (PERSON8): So not just this 6 years but all the years.
You have the ASR and the minute, right.
(PERSON8): Yes, so to find for each meeting- (PERSON4): Okay, because for- (PERSON8): Each transcript finds its minutes this is the- (PERSON4): The minutes, yes.
(PERSON4): So yea, so let's not be (PERSON8): Ye, ye it seems bigger but I meant just finding minutes for each transcript.
And [PERSON5] and please also send the automatic evaluation that the paper of <unintelligible> want to.
