(PERSON1) Yeah, so uh so I'll try to reconnect uh I'll uh yeah.
It's, uh uh uh it's it's great that, ah, the D- [PERSON4], you have thought of [PERSON5].
(PERSON1) Uh so if you uh [PERSON5] had the time uh obviously, there is no way we could do it for the next week.
(PERSON1) And uh af- I've asked [PERSON9] because I've seen uh the uh [PROJECT3] project uh demo.
(PERSON1) Well maybe I I I thought uh uh that that maybe some students of [PERSON11].
Uh, but uh, s- so that, uh, uh.
So I don't want to uh uh like uh defocus him too too much.
I would like to hear an update uh uh f- for the sessions uh for next week.
And get the uh uh get the uh, uh vocabulary.
(PERSON6) And uh I I just saw the uh program for ([PROJECT2]).
Okay, so in the afternoon, for example, in in the Czech afternoon, you are able to to uh to do something.
And I guess it's not that uh uh you could have a z- Zoom call again uh with the videos uh.
We have the the links, uh uh uh somewhere else maybe.
So like uh Zoom Test for uh two uh youtube uh videos at the same time.
So, and [PERSON6] [PERSON6] uh has been working on uh adaptation uh for the two domains.
Uh and then uh Friday uh um test uh time for two concurrent sessions.
So uh if [PERSON7] can uh uh do that.
Uh but still, if I am keeping track of the files, which uh needs to be manually converted so that I can write write a script.
Yeah, so this is uh <laugh> an important thing that we should have s- uh uh like c- come across, some months ago.
So for example, the call that I had uh that uh was someone was interviewing me.
And here we are running on the uh in the problems of conversion of the of the file formats.
(PERSON1) And there is uh the (money dogs), and these are important for uh the uh (CL) domain.
And uh so I know that [PERSON6] is working on the [PROJECT1] test for the two domains.
And uh uh uh uh I'm very curious.
So I'm I'm hoping that you will be able to have uh the multiple uh custom dictionaries in the ASR system.
So uh uh whatever you see uh b- by shown by [PERSON11] will be also useful for you.
(PERSON6) Uh I I received your email yesterday with uh the thing I was I mentioned in the <unintelligible> (ASL) system without using (pretest) (for pronunciations) was better than <unintelligible> (multiple pronunciations).
And so uh uh it the (ESL) decoded it as I think (for IBM).
And then I noted- uh, uh, uh, [PERSON2] produced uh the long uh word list, right?
(PERSON1) So you just convert the uh the uh international phonetic alphabet into the phonemes, uh, that uh uh that uh (cmu) knows.
I have to uh uh  I will have to leave now, because I need to give the kids, the, the, the lunch and so on.
And I think that this way uh the uh these uh systems should be able to to load it.
Uh, so that it works with the uh with the generated dictionary.
I'm finishing training of uh German ASR that may be used for for uh for uh time stamping.
Uh uh it uh they claimed it has uh more than 600 hours than a but uh uh the training set.
The uh the uh uh actual training set uh contains only around 300 hours.
Uh, used to observe uh her more steep conversions, and uh now it uh um.
I uhm take uh some uh samples uh f- of uh during the training.
(PERSON2) But uh if if you have uh transcript, and we want just to do uh just to do uh time stamping.
Uh and then uh [PERSON3] needs to prepare to have the double uh system running.
Uh and uh m- uh uh and improved numbers uh on Monday.
So the uh the uh (CL) decision uh really has to p- happen on Monday.
For the (saw) and uh s- uh uh for both the different tasks.
So uh actually, Mohammed compared the scores between, I think, uh it was (rainbow) and there (summer) set of workers.
Uh if not, then obviously we can uh fall back to uh the (rainbow).
(PERSON5) And basically the uh so the uh yes.
So uh so I, I now see that the the transcripts for for these files are don't have the right length.
(PERSON2) Uh uh I guess that they are so mhm.
But I'm uh uh I'm as sure I am <unintelligible> the main adaptation models.
Uh [PERSON5] can I uh just end the uh meeting?
