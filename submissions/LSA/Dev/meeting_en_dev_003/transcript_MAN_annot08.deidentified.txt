And and the other think if now we have to really (mobilize) our efforts tools the proposals.
Tho- these may change actually, but the proposal should look good with all the all the- (PERSON5) Yes, yes.
(PERSON3) And I <unintelligible>  I should be able to get back to all of you uh by the end of the week with the [ORGANIZATION1] data set.
I can lay- (PERSON5)  So you are now- so now you are active uhm you are you are wo- work in hard on [ORGANIZATION1].
Really takes time before we start (this) annotators work.
(PERSON3) So the <unintelligible> [PERSON5] like uhm I <unintelligible> late personally I would prefer the shared task to be as simple as possible, because even the task is hard.
And the in like uhm this (envisioned) to lose the evolution metrics that we are going to propose.
Should come in the second <unintelligible> like uhm not in the fast shared task.
(PERSON3) So I'm saying like uhm little skip the fast shared task as simple as possibly.
And I think it's it's good that we can involve annotators to- (PERSON5) But does <unintelligible> has does <unintelligible> have at least some minimal sense, doesn't <unintelligible> give some totaly unr- unrealistic numbers that doesn't that don't say anything serious about the quality of the annotations.
(PERSON5) So actually, why we want to run this [PERSON4] 's tool is that <unintelligible> has actually no real sense run estimating the summariz on the one hand, and on the other hand that manual metrix, manual evolutions that we have now are very very subjective and uhm kind of also very wake.
I would propose, yeah, so I would propose that uh before aaa like making the alignment to <unintelligible> part of shared tasks datas get the people on <unintelligible> exceptive somewhere.
(PERSON3) the data set the alignment tool gated accepted by the community.
What they actually minutes that for the shared task get as go with the really conventional thing that people do for summarization.
(PERSON5) Uhm probab- so I am  eager so I actually want to prepared to relieve you and I really trust for this questions.
Oh, okay, okay So but- (PERSON5) So that we could get manual evalutions and also some automatic metrics, and then compare them.
But maybe in this case, if you have a clear understanding what should we prepare before the end of November, tell me what should I do?
So I what I we do now is maybe from tomorrow on works I will start writing like <unintelligible> I have already the components nearly.
So it start (drafting) and then uhm we will definitely come up with some gaps that we need to killer.
Uhm did you already tried this [PERSON4]'s tool, did you think about how to organize this annotators work.
Because I would be now fully focused till November 30th on the shared task proposal.
So you are the only person who understand how this [PERSON4] 's tool wor- functions.
So I really need person, who will really <unintelligible> help me to begin work with annotators.
(PERSON5) Because I actually I'm kind of waiting all the times, so I don't really understand.
So I know how to in how to work within the tool, but uhm if uhm I send the link to the inc- to this tol- to my annotors and they have some questions, and they will have some questions, definitely because this is written in Python, and Python mostly has problems when install in that tool.
And it- So If the annotators come ups with questions, I would never able to answer.
So I really need a person who would be uhm by hand, so it would really help me all the time and in in this.
So but the thing is that once the once the annotator does the alignment, so what is the output of the tools.
This is just a alignment, just which part of what- So you mean uhm how it is can be useful for evaluation.
(PERSON3) So yes, for example, if you see uhm that (Jens) that minutes fix just smaller part of the transcript or uhm then so then they get less as smaller number of kind of in these evaluation.
(At this moment) I don't have any clear answer to your question and I also understand that it should be.
Uhm it should be stated clearly, but I I me and [PERSON1] have kind of strong intuition that it could help by evaluating.
<unintelligible> Yeah, that is that is very much clear, that if we definitely help for the evaluation, because oh yeah what you think in machine translation this alignment tool or alignment metric is uhm like very helps.
But you really ha- have a summarization office small piece of text.
So it could be so the text could be divided according of that, and that data in this are kind of (March and Margaret) in this way.
I just saying that this is already a good advantage to have smaller pieces of transcripts, and a correspondent summary line.
Very have many, many pieces of transcripts and many, many corresponding lines of summary.
So it could be kind also ano- uhm good training data.
So uhm so what <unintelligible> [PERSON5], I I I absolutely support you that we should start the this alignment thing with our annotators.
Somebody should say how to download the meeting, what to click to make it work, and where to put the data.
(PERSON5) But uhm may I ask [PERSON2] and Thirtankar if you could just join to you to together and discr- and discuss the technical details.
(PERSON5) Are are <unintelligible> I 'm looking forward to started from this from September, because I think we have a lot of data and I 'm so I 'm still (waiting on terms) for creating uhm kind of uhm double summarize for meetings that are already minuted.
Okay, so, and and annotating [PERSON5] I would one to mention like before <unintelligible> giving the minutes to the annotators we must be sure that which transkripts or minutes <unintelligible> really part of the data set, because some of them- (PERSON5) Yes.
(PERSON2) So [PERSON5] what exactly do you want as one from us like to start the annotation work, because I think we should do it as soon as possible, because it will it is going to get a lot of time.
What what <unintelligible> I just try to my annotator know you will do the alignment of this and this, you find guidelines on this link.
So by the end of the week, we will have answers to all of this to connect to the annotators.
But yes- <unintelligible> First we speak about it but that I will I can org- so this is the topic you ar- you actually promised me last week that we could make this call with annotators but what do we <unintelligible> them?
I I have to schedule a session with you [PERSON2], because uhm there are too many things on my plate now, so I will definitely need hands.
I had the f- so  I think we ho- we will as- he will join us uhm when we discuss the evaluation maybe, not today.
(PERSON3) Okay, we put that to the agenda, like I'm like <unintelligible> so many things, so it's the proposal that data for [ORGANIZATION1] and uhm and a tool.
