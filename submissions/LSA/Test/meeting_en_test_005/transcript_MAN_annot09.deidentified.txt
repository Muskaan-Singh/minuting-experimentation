(PERSON7) Yeah, so the recognition works (wee), but I'm unable to us the microphone for the call itself.
(PERSON7) So, <laugh>, thank you <unintelligible> for joining, I actually <ehm> assumed that you will be away
(PERSON7) So (I'l), stop my camera, share my screen, <ehm>,  <other_noise>
(PERSON7) so all of your imputs, <ehm>, and all target languages in the presentation platform -
(PERSON7) So if we are able to <eh> provide the interpretors with the immediate feedback, I believe the quality would be much <ehm> better.
(PERSON13) I guess it should not, but I don't know about the capacity of the switch, so, yeah, I should check.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so the idea is to - to have <ehm> notebooks also in the interpreters' (booths), but we can run into physical limits, maybe there is not enough space on their desk and - and so on.
(PERSON7) What is my little worry is thay we will actually need yet another <ehm> for couple of ASR, the corresponding language <ehm> ASR workers.
(PERSON7) So this is <ehm>, pl- please discuss this a- if you say it's too complicated let's - let's give up on this.
(PERSON2) <ehm>, you will have - those service languages displayed also in the main page <parallel_talk> Yeah <\parallel_talk> of presentation platform.
(PERSON7) So if you have any ideas <ehm> what to ask, simply create a random questions we'll (polish) this.
(PERSON2) The fun- functionalities and - you know (there're two) <ehm> maybe presentation(al) platform more  comfortable <parallel_talk> Great <\parallel_talk> for the user.
(PERSON7) So, if I - when I visit [PERSON1] in his offices, I need to show my ID, they record <other_noise> and - and so on.
(PERSON3) <ehm> I am checking my microphone, because - I don't see my name like <unintelligible> <ehm>, so I thought it was broken and now it's finally working <parallel_talk> We can hear you, we can hear you <\parallel_talk>, okay.
the - like the biggest thing would be to watch our participants from behind <laugh>.
(PERSON7) No - no, I don't know, we hear someone typing <em> (very) loud.
(PERSON7) Yeah, so maybe we have the problem with the input quality, which can happen <ehm> all the time -
(PERSON7) Yeah, so that's - <ehm> my voice correctly arise, so (not) French, Hungary, Italian, <ehm> Dutch, Polish, Romanian, Spanish -
(PERSON22) Yes tody I wrote them email to run- ten (two) segmenters, but they didn't replied.
(PERSON8) <laugh> I don't think it's (logging) anything but, <unintelligible> is looking for the long files.
(PERSON8) (Okay, I can) - <parallel_talk> What I noticed in the English channel is that <ehm> I still see a lot of <ehm> old English subtitles, some words about microprhone and recognising and reasonable - <\parallel_talk>
(PERSON2) But actu- (but and) I think that <unintelligible> is that <ehm> there still be  in- incremental transcription problem to be (solved out).
(PERSON2) A- are you working on - on this problem or - or actually with (this) integration the - (keep) the ASR or -   <other_noise>
(PERSON8) (Beside) - <ehm> yeah, we (don't) just (aware) <unintelligible> we're talking about this the other day (and we've forgotten), m- partially the same thing <unintelligible> actually ASR.
and then they <unintelligible> a new start time, when <ehm> it goes on in the press (diction).
(PERSON8) Yeah, so, <other_noise> ([PERSON4]) - ([PERSON4]) - ([PERSON4]) just said these <unintelligible> loging to check this- <ehm>
(PERSON8) Am- I - I think the idea is he logs it to - to determine that it really is the algorithm specified to the paper.
(PERSON8) Yes, (so) he hasn't made any changes, we only noticed the paper yesterday.
() Only the Romanian is running, but I can't see any output from it.
(PERSON7) Yeah, I - I don't see any output <ehm> inthe Romanian subtitles either.
(PERSON22) <ehm> I - I asked the ASR workers, they are running or not or if they are available but - not responding.
(PERSON7) <unintelligible> who available o (the ASR) workers, ane <parallel_talk> For some reason (anyone here won't be) - <ehm> in the call.
(PERSON7) [PERSON22] emailed them <ehm> yesterday <ehm> and they did not respond to that email at all <unintelligible> <cough> five minutes ago and <unintelligible> didn's respond either.
(PERSON22) Now we - I can - or I can't share the screen, I  - <other_yawn> we have there two- two ASR workers from English, which are available.
(PERSON8) But you're talking <unintelligible> it (didn't occur) - <parallel_talk> Yeah I'm talkin now.
(PERSON7) How many ASR workers are available and - <parallel_talk> Two are registered as available, but one of them is not working, so I try this scond one.
<ehm> did we use the <unintelligible> send the audio in the (march fair)?
(PERSON2) Actually <ehm> [PERSON16] told me that [PERSON20] i- is (off) office at the moment.
(PERSON7) So, <ehm> please make sure this doesn't hap- again - happen again that we are - like - reaching you and all the possible ways.
(PERSON5) (Který ty data si myslel [PERSON7]?)
(PERSON5) oni sou taky v jinym formátu, než potřebujem.
(PERSON3) Yes, that's correct, because for the- at least for the event it would be nice to have it mandatory, probably with some - at least a simple password.
(PERSON2) Actually, <ehm> there's a problem in <unintelligible> for storying a used data.
(PERSON2) And we require <ehm> much more <ehm> deep reasoning about it and this is the reason why in this version of this presentation platform we didn't store any <unintelligible> data.
(PERSON3) So now we should see French subtitles from English source from one recording from last year -  workshop.
(PERSON3) Yes, I can't get any output from segmenter but I <unintelligible> get it from ASR.
(PERSON3) I - I (launched) two instances of ebclient, two identical ones, one was from (NEU-lecture) <unintelligible> hybrid, into NEU text, and it doesn't output anything, and the second one was the same and it -
(PERSON5) So I am - I right now have ten instances of this running all (off) (putting) hard files I - I don't even know which one you're connected to.
my - microtest script  wit- with a test case and - and upload it to the (crise) control (repo).
(PERSON3) Yes, so I'm - I'm - I will write <unintelligible> script as - as for the testing the ASR that it- it starts so many instances of - of the ebclient to send audio to ASR(+) segmenter - <parallel_talk> Yes.
