Yeah, we can- we can start with the [PROJECT4] I guess, because [PERSON4]can provide feedback, right?
(PERSON4) But uhm [PERSON7] also wanted to, like properly decide uh [ORGANIZATION3]'s or (the quality) estimation stuff, and so-
But uh I think the k- the big paper is not happening, because there is just no, any data.
(PERSON4) Like, in like s- seven or ten days (of running this) experiment, there is like only two people who finished the-
I- we decided uh after that meeting that w- we should invest our time in our-
So uh, it's not even expected to- to have results for- for this- this deadline, right?
To- I don't know, maybe writing things, we can think about uh alternatives or limitations.
Um so far I- I just organize the- the sections in bullet points.
(PERSON6) No- no I'm- I'm really starting to write to- this week <laugh>.
One of our colleagues is actually main- maintaining uh, a overview of the important dates for conferences, so this might be helpful to [PERSON2].
(PERSON2) [PERSON9] uh, told us about the the data set that has multip- multi-reference.
So f- uh we have only 50 unique English sentences and each of those was equipped with as many references as people could come up with.
So several uh- dozen thousand references, uh p- per sentence.
S- so they actually the uh- the system outputs were manually post-edited and then someone else, a secondary annotator, confirmed whether they are good translation or not.
And that's uh, if I'm not mistaken about six hundred unique uh- source sentences.
Like whe- I'm not sure whether you, [PERSON9] and [PERSON2] y- you are more comfortable with weekly or bi-weekly meetings, but I think, the task shoulds definitely, have- uh like separate, designated meeting for for for these detail- detailed discussion, right?
Every day and (don't know), I I I'm I'm, you, you s- you dec- you decide it, what- what is the best uh date for that.
(PERSON6) Okay, so so uh let's let's leave it to [PERSON9], because he's- he's the most busy person.
The daily reports or calls should be also beneficial in a way, that you're more socialized with the, with the rest of the team, or at least with so- some of people.
We- we may keep those and just keep them, keep them short if necessary and and, like st- stay- s- let's stay with the daily calls for the time being.
Uh, because, well there was a meeting last St- Thursday and I think we covered, everything we need.
And if we don't have anything else to discuss, we can probably, uh, end this call for today, right, [PERSON9]?
I think, yeah, if I'm correct like we- we got the response or [PERSON10] already wrote an e-mail to the [ORGANIZATION5] [ORGANIZATION5] people but they, didn't reply yet, right?
Uh [PERSON2], you- you also didn't receive any reply for the [PERSON10]'s e-mail?
I don't think we need to like ur- urge them or pu- push them to- for replying yet, right?
(PERSON9) And I have a quick uh update for [PERSON4]on something totally different.
(PERSON4) It was confusing, cause I thought that they wanted it really fast, but then it stalled for like-
Still we are waiting for the, uhm [ORGANIZATION7] to actually do their part of the work and they- they have problems obviously to get, volunteers.
(PERSON4) The issue is that we don't have any native English speakers on our faculty.
(PERSON4) Uh- I don't know, just I feel like [ORGANIZATION7]'s- seriously dropped the ball on- this project.
But the problem is that [PERSON5] is taking care of this and he will be leaving the project and-
(PERSON6) Maybe it would be good idea to ask who is taking over, an- and and start uh, bothering the other person with- with this.
So <laugh> we should uh, count on the option that they totally fail to deliver anything useful.
And it's always like that, yeah, it's- it- it- it's unfortunately the- the general rule of- of life, so if you are searching for a helping hand, you will always find it at the end of your shoulder.
So they are expected to provide the speakers and they are uh, like failing, right?
So that the task is easier for [PERSON10] to accomplish even with uh people leaving.
(PERSON4) But I don't know what exactly I should write into the paper, because we already had ten people do this experiment, which is five times more than what we already have from [ORGANIZATION7] and-
Yeah, I- I think y- you <other_noise> sh- you should definitely try- try asking [PERSON10], like what are the other options, right?
So during the last week when I, uhm, ta- took vacation, I was just baby sitting the jobs.
Uh as a miracle after I, I wrote you, the message, I got many GPUs available, I don't know, how it's possible, [PERSON6] <laugh>
I think in, two or three days, like if, if the tempo is the same, remains the same uh, I should have all the data translated.
And then I can uh, uhm train, the systems with this monolingual or back translated data included.
Do- do w- do we want to uh participate with something, for example with [PROJECT4], or I don't know.
So some deadline will appear and we are planning to use this for [PROJECT3] uh demo p- submission.
(PERSON6) Well I think- I think for the demonstration it- it m- should be focused more on the- on the framework itself, right, no- not on the, experiment results.
Well it's it's just the that- that to keep that in mind, it would definitely give us some bonus points with the reviewers later, right.
(PERSON4) Like like we are looking for native English speakers, how are we supposed to disseminate this?
Yeah, I- I know like I'm really dissatisfied with this and I know that uh, this should be-
(PERSON9) Yeah, I I I'm happy to see that [PERSON7] is not as depressed as I understood from what [PERSON4]was saying, so yes, exactly, this is the uh the approach that you should be taking.
So, I guess that uh we've discussed everything we needed so we can uhm, like end it here right, for today?
