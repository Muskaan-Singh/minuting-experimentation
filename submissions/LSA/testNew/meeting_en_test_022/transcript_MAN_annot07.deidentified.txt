(PERSON1) Not very specific I wanted to thank you for preparing this Google forms for alignment annotations.
To have all this spreadsheet with all the annotators that download their data there, it's very nice.
As specifically I need to do very quickly for the like for the workshop proposal.
So, so let me just quickly give you an overview.
That what, what we have to do very quickly is we have to uh set up the website now.
So, Ah I have connected to the person whom [PERSON4] reffered.
So, let me first look into that um, like, how does it works, uh, to do with <unintelligible> and something.
(PERSON1) So the website of Ah, the <unintelligible>, of the, of the special event.
Uh the dates and the submission information type in the review process, location and stuff.
So I will like uh start writing them here today.
Like, let me write it first version, and then, um, like maybe you, [PERSON3] and [PERSON4] should comment on that.
Please try to invite people for like reviewers for the share task <unintelligible>.
Yeah, so I will share with both of you a <unintelligible> e-mail for that we will resending to people we know and we want to-
(PERSON2) We have to show we have a good program committee.
(PERSON1) They will know that they are good, but at the same time they will not know that they are summarization people.
So even big and like agree to do uh review at least one or two papers.
(PERSON2) You can just ask them, because eventually, like finally, it depends on how many papers we are getting.
And then we can invite more people based on how many papers we are getting, okay?
So that is <unintelligible>  requirement, but for in the website we have to show at least, I will say approximately around more than 20 people in the program committee.
So like we have many good uh contexts, like, for example, from [ORGANIZATION1] only we can have two or more than three or four people.
Just Google Docs is kind of uh it does not work today.
But the new Google documents are, so don't work.
So these are the, like, immediate pending task for preparing the proposals.
Because, you know, like um, usually in workshop, like we used to have a big organizing committee, and some people are from <unintelligible>.
So that is, anyway, I did not thought like, um, like making a share task would be that much challenging.
Well, I <unintelligible> that it is challenging since why I was so much unsure about making workshop that.
(PERSON2) Yeah, the actually, like we are also doing uh some workshops with <unintelligible>.
But thing is that there are like, like, the organizing committee is very big.
And also a bit on writing the paper uh for that uh, but I did not like, um, <unintelligible> share task I guess it there is so many things that we need to take care of.
(PERSON2) And the thing is like for us full legit workshop we don't have content.
(PERSON2) Yes and I believe, like if to make it a workshop we definitely need at least one or two people who have a background in summarization.
(PERSON1) Yes, well, actually this discussion makes me totally frustrated.
Because originally, we planned and make a work, a shirt task.
It means to give the participants a totally new task and asked them to make mixed experiment and then compare the results.
Because uh we have <unintelligible> to some like prominent people in summarization.
(PERSON2) Yes, yes, many, me and [PERSON4] we, we addressed at least six to seven people from summarization community.
(PERSON2) But they are very, like they are very famous professors, including [PERSON6], <unintelligible> and-
(PERSON2) But the thing is that we <unintelligible> to like the like what unquote very famous people from some relation who were like, you know.
If we could have reached out to some early career people that would have been great from summarization.
(PERSON2) I'm going to ask him to be part of the program committee.
(PERSON1) Yeah, <unintelligible> is definitely a good idea.
He should be, if he agrees, he is a good part of an organizing committee.
So from this <unintelligible> media generations so, little bit younger, say.
But feel uh [ORGANIZATION2] is is organizer, so it does not make sense, like someone from [ORGANIZATION1], right?
(PERSON2) As a <unintelligible> does it make sense like someone from [ORGANIZATION1] to deliver the keynote?
(PERSON1) As as I think about summarization, I knew just a couple of very young students who began to do the year.
(PERSON2) Ehm, I can e-mail him or how do you propose to ask him?
(PERSON1) Ok, let <unintelligible>, write him an e-mail, yes.
It doesn't have sense to thing about to to discuss summarization.
[PERSON3] do you want to like share or we can drop for today.
