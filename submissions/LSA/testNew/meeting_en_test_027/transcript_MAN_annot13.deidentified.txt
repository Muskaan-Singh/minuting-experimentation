And just to be complete we are also going to also talk about the the nominal <unintelligible> of-.
(PERSON2) Yeah, I got it built on during the <unintelligible> And it came one and half or two months ago actually.
As the New Year is king of expected of but filled more with assignments, projects <laugh>, these kinds of stuff you know.
Or the items, that I want, to, bring up, uh, are the two sessions that we have.
So [PROJECT2] is the Holocaust survivor's session And the [PROJECT3] has been postponed by a month.
So I am, I'm like I will be quite honest because I'm like slumbered with the homework, the assignments and exams approaching.
So after a month when I get time I think I can get quickly to the project <unintelligible>.
So in case you had some extra time I suggest that you talk directly to [PERSON3]-.
<laugh> Uh, I'm I'm sending a question to [PERSON5] now, so the the second event, the [PROJECT3] will have two parts.
And that will be interleaved with a real live discussion, which will take place, in the [PROJECT3].
We need someone to take care of the recording, so the archiver person.
So I think that that would be probably the easiest, uh, to just put up the tables as HTML.
Um, to to tell us whether the Weights and Biases, which is a web based solution.
Some start up company which offers, uh, accounts for academic purposes for free, if that would help us are or not.
Um, yeah, okay, so Weights and Biases this is not really, uh, recommended by [PERSON9].
So that means moving the few scripts to, uh, where they belong from [PROJECT1] test set and some automatic runner.
Or what you could even do, is to have a full, uh, Git check out, uh, directly located in this public HTML or simling from that public HTML.
So this, this would be useful, especially for people outside of [ORGANIZATION3] such as, [ORGANIZATION4], uhm, we know they have like- The performance was was bad for some of the files and they could directly, uh, browse it on the web.
I mean, we are reporting the numbers of words, so, the statistics about the transcript percent, right?
Originally we wanted to get an idea about, uh, the conversion, like the world ratio of two languages for a given transcript.
So I guess we had a proposed that if there are some lines which are coming from, uh, [PROJECT5] and we want to remove it.
Or we had to remove the empty lines, uh, due to profanity filtering.
Uh, this involves also manual preparation of the reference, so, hm, both need manual-, uh, manually created references.
(PERSON3) So, uh, I think we need to improve our segmenter, the worlds are getting revised fine.
But, uh, get in touch with [PERSON13] and get some delay scores for some of the files from the [PROJECT1] test set.
So, segmenter is related tom this a lot, so that's why <unintelligible> it occurred to me that we need that.
The plan and the goal is, of course, to put this into the regularly produced tables, but now do it just for one file.
For both of the sessions, [PROJECT2] and [PROJECT3] I do already want to choose the system the the pipeline from some choices, and this has to be based on some numbers.
We have always used just some of the system and and not really thought about which one, but let's really start making an informed choice.
But on the other hand, um, benefit of the common voice is that we have additional information about gender and speakers.
to [PERSON14] and [PERSON15] so to the [ORGANIZATION4] people asking about links to the data, and they still didn't respond.
Uh, but I think that already this baseline should be geared towards non native speakers.
So you should, uh, like clean or make yourself familiar with the data on our disks and put it there.
(PERSON2) Uh, like, in building a non native speech, uh, automated system, for tor some languages, as a part of my, as a part of the masters thesis.
So then we are with the most up-to-date version of our remote <unintelligible> (PERSON2) Yeah, said the sounds.
Actually I wanna ask, so, uh, when do you finalise for the replacement for [PERSON7].
Or if you did, then maybe we could include him as well in the call, so that essentially he will also be training [PROJECT5] systems if he is to replace [PERSON7].
And this, uh, this week, I implemented or or trained speech language identification.
I have a model for Czech, German and English which kind of works on YouTube videos in Euro parliament.
It in works in online mode, with three seconds delay, and I 'm going to integrate it into the mediator and create one s simple start up script to increase control so anyone can use it.
And then I'm going to analyze the ASI dev <unintelligible> data and then probably [PROJECT7] training or anything else.
Subtitler study where we are aiming for the end of the month deadline, right?
And and and class, you can see the silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the others how they want to use it, in, the, pipeline.
<other_noise> And also to this language ID worker, and then we need to merge these outputs.
That's the [PROJECT7] tool, which will be preserving these text outputs and also following the time stamps <other_noise>.
So, we need to figure out, which way, um, uh, is of integrating the language ID is the best for our purposes.
And later, when [PERSON4] would have a multilingual model of [PROJECT5], uh, that language ID would not even be needed.
(PERSON3) Um, I mean it kind of does, but it will like <unintelligible> bias the translations.
So, uh, I mean to interpret - Or they talked about how the computer had learned to try, or to interprete- Or it created one language on it's own.
(PERSON3) Uh, so, it it was not necessarily a bilingual, it it was a multi lingual model.
