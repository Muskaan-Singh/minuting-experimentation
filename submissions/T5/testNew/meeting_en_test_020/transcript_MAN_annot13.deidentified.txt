if you plan to make a special challenge session, you should follow the same criteria as all other papers .
if it would be a satellite event, you have to coordinate it with something like unintelligible> two more higher .
this gives us much more flexibility and freedom to choose our event .the proposal for a [ORGANIZATION16] workshop this year is over .
the next proposal would come for 2022, which would be too late for us .
if we get either of the two, we have to go on trying and see .if we are going for special session, we have to strictly follow whatever [ORGANIZATION4] says .
the last time that that differed was five months between proposals and final paper submission .
but this time it is only three months, so uh, that is one unintelligible> here.we have to make a full fledged, uh, proposal for workshop program and then submit .
we don't need twelve submissions.
we can even do with five, six submissions .
if we conduct a separate workshop, we can set it up.
(PERSON1) Yeah, but it means double work .last three, four days, it was too much hectic for me .
we have to take out institutional membership to submit the proposal .
membership to [ORGANIZATION12] is not a problem at all.(PERSON3) I think machine translation will be mostly focused on machine translation .
if a person is aware of this, then they can be interested in it .
in [ORGANIZATION17] it is not mentioned on the website, I wonder why .[PROJECT3] from [ORGANIZATION15] will be indexed in unintelligible> .
[PERSON4] will take care of that.
(PERSON3) Yeah, it is a little less work and intent and more intensive output.[PROJECT4] is indexed by unintelligible> directly .
[PERSON3] I think we can defer this discussion .
uh, we can also do it as part of the 'unintellligible' forum .
(PERSON1) Yes, yes, unfortunately, it is double work .
