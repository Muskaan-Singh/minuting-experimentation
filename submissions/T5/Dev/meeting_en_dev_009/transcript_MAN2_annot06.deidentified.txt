this is the early session that I'm unintelligible> of approach we need some domain adaptation again .
the goal of office would be obviously to describe the pipeline .last year we were only reusing the system from [ORGANIZATION4] and it went for single minute of the two days .
we are also going to (writers), well it will depend what the they will let us or not .
for that we would highly benefit from having some profanity filtering .this week I work on do the collection is business for [OTHER1] and English .
15000 sentences is crawled automatically using automatic clover for both languages .
and we need clean all the data because some duplicate sentences and some other garbage values .i believe in the putting up the unintelligible> top of list .
the list will never be complete and it will contain many words which we actually like .
i think that we could do it monolingualy and use back translation to create the other part .in the TOK on Tuesday [PERSON3] didn't say "soupatko" again so the scrotum did not reappear .
but still we would like to have a chance to prevent unintelligible> respond of them .it appears that thursday lunch time is the bad time in this corpus .
we have correct english transcript much large of volume and we have limited file only in [LOCATION4] and [OTHER1] .
but unfortunately I'm not sure I have access to unintelligible> .czech speaker has experimented with various technics .
he was quite happy with result as quite a lot of domain specific words were recognized by the model .[PERSON1] is coming back to back to [LOCATION1] on the weekend .
who won't be available during the unintelligible> Then may have more time for for that .[PERSON14] has already worked on the project last june when he was helping us to put all the (byplans) together .
he can participate only remotedly and there for also whatever he does has to be like self contain as little interaction as possible .i saw that there's any paper from [ORGANIZATION3] from december on ASR and it is called FastSpeech .
I just tried it today and it's just basicly sais that it s like three hundred times faster for ASR .
they also say it is robust and dust nearly eliminates words keeping unintelligible> which is also interesting .
