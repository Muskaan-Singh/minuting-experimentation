the data deadline has already come .
it is November 30th.
(feasible) November 3rd.
(Person5) November 30 .
(PERSON5) I think we should get back to all of you uhm by the end of the week with the [ORGANIZATION1] data set .if we don't use the 'unintelligible' tool, we won't be able to use it at the community .
if it's not in the fast shared task, we'll mix up too many things in one place .
but if uhm skip the quick shared task as simple as possible .uhm evaluate some meetings based on the automatic evaluation metrics that we have .
and then show unintelligible> to all of us .
could you try these metrics on the meeting on these? (PERSON5) Yeah, yeah.
Okay .
if you have a clear understanding of what to do, send email .'i'm kind of waiting all the times, so I don't really understand' 'if uhm I send the link to the inc- to this tol- to my annotors and they will have some questions, I would never able to answer.'once the tool does the alignment, so what is the output of the tools? uhm yes, this is an important question, but this is not just for that .
we need a unintelligible> idea how to use it .if you want to transfer it to [PERSON2] maybe it would be also possible.
(PERSON2) I'm here unintelligible>.if you want to transfer it's okay with me.
(PERSON2) Yeah, I don't mind it we started an hour earlier than normally today .
if we will have enough money next year for example, it really take a lot of time .by the end of the week, we will have answers to all of this to connect to the annotators .
(PERSON5) Okay, this should be done.
(Person5) Perfect.
Thank you.(PERSON3) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm looking forward to that [ORGANIZATION1] data to unintelligible> by the end of this week .
