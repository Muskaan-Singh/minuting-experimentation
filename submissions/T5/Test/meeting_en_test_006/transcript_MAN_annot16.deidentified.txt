"i'm starting the web that how to like find what is actually there in the [ORGANIZATION2] corpus" for each transcript in europarl you can find the minutes .
[PERSON5] prepaired some crieteria so the guidelines for the evaluation .if you follow the link you can also open the search for minutes .
the name could be from the data, europarl data .
but i didn't find it, but yes .ehm is the figure number two.
They have given this for user ratings .
this is just a web application which they have mentioned the entire thing .
if you could just scroll down a little [PERSON8], yea .annotators are asking by scene board the transcript and the summary .
based on the web interface, they give cautions to the annotator .
that awaited score can be calculated automatically .
so building an interface would be a good thing ."i'm absolutely okay with the interface.
but before the interface we need to be sure about that." "I'm reading the paper how to actually add interface some constant values.
In that equation.if you give to ten annotators.
Definitely they are also gonna have judge .
PERSON8: i think it is a good idea so we can easily finalize the draft ."for the first shared task I would like absolutely keep everything as simple as possible" "i did implement all of the existing to matrix.
But not something new," says PERSON5 .
"if we are able to align minutes and transcripts automatically what? "transcripts are already available and the minutes are also available .
so if you extract all the meetings that are available, then the data set is even more .
but you buy alignment you mean that within a folder for one meeting .
