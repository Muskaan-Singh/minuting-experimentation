[PERSON14] The problem is that we haven t that defined what does it mean to add new content .
[Person6] Um, um, so the content is there .
the next phase should have been commenting on, on others text .[PERSON6] I'm just planning to rewrite what s already there .
if you have a box of chocolate and you just plan to arrange the chocolate nicely, you're just rearranging what 's already in the box' .
[Person14] Yeah, I tried adding one picture and that's about the way I can add pictures .[PERSON6] This is archive but archive lists the licence .
if it's from ACL antology it s creative comments atribution 4.0 international .
[Person20] Yeah, it doesn't give me any .
rights.
It's just for archive .laugh> [PERSON6] Yeah, that s, that is true .
[Person14] You at least unintelligible> year .
'i don t know where to prove it like these are syntax but, but the other ones like gender of nouns .[PERSON14] I have it much easier in the (presence) trees, constituency trees .
[Person14] And, and, and coreferences .
there are also one problems if these element of (contextual) embeddings is not included .the problem is that, that (lighting) doesn't want to do the words through, through Overlap .
[PERSON6] Smaller font unintelligible> image .
and then transfer it .some parts still need to be rewritten and the pictures may-, must be done better .
'this is more or less written but yeah, these are, these two texts are very, very similar' 'i'm not sure if it belongs here or what to do with it'if you shift the mean of the Glove colour scale you might end up with the same image as they had .
[PERSON24] Yeah, but it s strange that the FastText .
shows this structure right away .
but if .
you include these extremes then most of it will be squashed .[PERSON24] s figures.
I will either move it to your chapture or delete it .
if I make the subsign smaller it will get fixed probably .
this is the very first image I made in tix and the code is really terrible .[PERSON14] Yeah, you can make the figures, improve the figures .
if we don't change the content of the figures just how they look, it's no problem .
[Person14] You will have figures in the missing sections like PCA and ICA .[PERSON24] Okay, I ll transform this from a bit map into proper text after everything else is done .
if you don t see the, the green lines and I don't see that it is really done in the comment I will, I will send you something .[PERSON24] I think we should all read it all of book and comment it what is missing where and yeah, where are the problems and other things .
if we have one unintelligible> reviewer from [LOCATION1], it s OK .
[Person14] Yeah, it would be at least abstract or I don t know if I ask only .do we have, um, conclusion or sum-, summary of our book? I think not yet .
there are no rules in the books series that we should have a book summary .[PERSON14] I think longest book would be the (light) lexikons .
[Person27] might be a good candidate .
longest book is unintelligible> .there are some citations that are not in the Zotero format so they re deffinitely will bee always missing .
[PERSON6] unintelligible> this is, this is for now .
the next meeting is in two weeks, Monday.
13th july .[PERSON6] I have holiday from Thursday but I think I will do some work even in the holiday .
[Person24] I also officialy have holiday next week but I will be working .
if he organises something that i will join happily, [person6] .[PERSON6] I don t know if people can watch if they re not registered .
[Person14] unintelligible> because we need to pay for it and if we don't have any, any paper there .
(PERSON14) other_noise> .
