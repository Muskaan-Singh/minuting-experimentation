 And because the from the Ger- [OTHER1] thing of the office I have downloaded 1970 to 1980 pdf files which is extracted which was extracted from the [OTHER2] using texted [OTHER3] so just can work in text format.
(PERSON2) OK, so so what would be your collaboration with [PERSON6] then if you if you were available? Well in the TOK on Tuesday [PERSON3] didn't say "soupatko" again so the scrotum did not reappear.
So I used two different segmentation for this, one is timebase and second is wordbase anyway everything is almost ready.
 So I've experimented with various technics and especially like domain adaptation of a language model and then acoustic fine tuning on [PERSON3] talk.
Yes, right now I'm working on a next version of the czech ASR system that should be trained on even more data.
[PERSON1] has found the appropriate command flacs so that the audio is compress to mp3 then shiped as mp3 to network and then decompress before being sent to the ASR.
(PERSON9) Okay, if it is still deleted then I can then I can started next week.
So, I think that's we should stop again today it's then spent more time we wanted.
