 (PERSON4) Yeah I was I was ready to type PIN PIN but I wasn't actually prompted for.
The idea is you usually bypass the Mtray- M3U8 URL putting the frame in the [ORGANIZATION5] server which expose also the SSL certificate.
So I'm I'm serving like regular files and I don't know how to how to stream.
Actually I haven't yet finished to prepare this kind of pipe but I'm already able to swim an MP4 video file.
Then we could set up an account for you so that there would be a net cut solution, like a horrible one.
While [PERSON7] and [PERSON10] and [PERSON6] will focus on the on the technical aspect.
So the plan B, that I have with [PERSON7] is that we will use this standard Youtube included Youtube iFrame within the presentation platform.
And if there could be client it's working, I'm now putting it together with the other piece of the pipeline.
(PERSON9) Well, I think it's very good to explain how badly it it like handles non-native speech.
And one thing that I also wanted to talk [PERSON7] is that we really need to test restarts.
(PERSON9) Yeah, ok, so let me disconnect now and you keep talking and and oh this is this only end meeting.
Well [PERSON4] and [PERSON12], we are going to work on the technical set up.
Then I'm going to search for something for you [PERSON7] in order to pipe text to the presentation platform.
Is it possible for us to look in on the HTTPS web server, the [ORGANIZATION5] the [ORGANIZATION5]'s one? (PERSON7) Yeah I think so, but I will be using basically 2 machines during the demo.
1 machine to run the set up and the other machine I think to inter- to talk with VS.
Then run FFM peg in order to create the M3U8 playlist which is a standard to for for web streaming videos.
We will be able to both stream the video on a public URL and provide input to AB client.
(PERSON7) So could you demonstrate how the plan C which you're doing on your localhost right now? [PERSON6] Ok, I can explain you one half the part which involves the ehm video streaming.
[PERSON6] And the second part is the one who's working on [PERSON10] in this moment.
These takes an input the file Boris zero one zero one MP4 which is the video file I would like to stream.
(PERSON7) Aha ok so it's like kind of frame window which is being updated every second or every few seconds.
[PERSON6] I can put it also in VLC, for example in VLC you can open the network stream.
For example we can organize still in the share screen put also a VLC for example which plays audio video.
[PERSON6] If I, because, for example, if I'm joining the the conference call.
[PERSON6] Yea.
unfortunately I have still just I have just half an hour and then I have to leave unfortunately.
(PERSON7) I think [PERSON3] [PERSON3] is responsible responsible for so, we actually need to book Zoom meeting slot.
[PERSON6] Because it's really really something stupid that I'm not getting exactly what it is.
