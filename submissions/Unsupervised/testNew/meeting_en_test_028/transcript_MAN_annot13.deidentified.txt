 Please get in touch with [PERSON10], uh and, uh, try to debug the, that again.
(PERSON3) Now, I am looking so i can just upload it as a link file or something like that.
(PERSON1) So, uh, that is uh, uh, I, don't think that is needed.
Yeah, unfortunately, I'm still horribly struggling with the [ORGANIZATION10], uh, [ORGANIZATION10] demo papers which are due tomorrow.
And, uh, I have now, uh, started worrying about the calculations of a number of things.
And in the [PROJECT9] environment I explained in two cases, German to English and English to German what is probably going to-.
(PERSON1) Yeah, so so [PERSON3], you should work on the evaluations first and fore- (PERSON1) Thanks [PERSON7] for the suggestion, uh, to just to use [PROJECT7] audio codec.
Uh, whereas we need English, uh, in, like on the 25th like in 10 days.
So then, [PERSON7], uh since I've already asked you, uh, please summarize for everybody.
And, uh, yes, and uh, so, and then the second item you have in your list [PERSON7].
 So, uh, it would be best, if you could get in touch with [PERSON9].
I have already provided, uh, [PROJECT2], one [PROJECT2] interview in the confidential part.
(PERSON2) Okay, and, I, I will also send you another [PROJECT10] repository, which we have that, Oh, actually, [PERSON4] [PERSON4] [PERSON4] you're here and you did not say anything.
For example, for English, and I 'm now working on English and, um, I cut the recordings, uh, to words.
But, uh, the problem is with Czech, because, uh, the [PROJECT15] speech for example has a  But, uh, I'm not sure I should be paid from [PERSON17]'s [PROJECT11] tool.
And now I would like to talk to uh, uh, [PERSON6] and of course [PERSON8].
(PERSON1) Uh, yes, but this is not the same as what I'm asking for.
Uh, and by that, we do bring in the 1500, as the expected time for "said".
(PERSON1) I'm thinking, so I'll I'll write the paper as if we are doing this already.
(PERSON1) Uh, my question on [PERSON8] and you is now, if we if you are able to, uh, come up with an example so that we would actually replace the.
Because for example, the only acceptable reason the translator didn't  for example write this other word is waiting for this one.
So, [PERSON8], if if you could look for examples like the one in the [PROJECT9] case, that would be great.
 (PERSON1) Yeah, so there I I 'm not sure if I actually wrote the questions down.
So, it's it's okay in the simply like calculation that O is located at 235, because, that is when O was emitted.
 (PERSON1) It is not on C.
There is two, 0,  four, and not two, three, five.
(PERSON6) Ah, first time you see the 0, the first time you see this,.
(PERSON1) Fe-, feel, feel free to switch to Persian for now if it's faster.
Like if you have, uh,1986, uh, then that would be four characters in the transcript, and then very long, uh, time span.
(PERSON6) But, but is is mainly for when we, for example, we do not have any alignment information.
First ot finds the place, for example, is between the word of, for example, the first and the second word.
Ah, so, uh, please like get in touch with [PERSON3] and [PERSON7] and try to integrate the profanity filtering yourselves.
