 (PERSON1) Many of my friends are having Covid now.
(PERSON1) Not very specific I wanted to thank you for preparing this Google forms for alignment annotations.
(PERSON2) Ok, so [PERSON1] I was like looking through the task that we need to do.
That what, what we have to do very quickly is we have to uh set up the website now.
So I'm get to see that how it looks like to do with the [ORGANIZATION1], ah, website.
Like, let me write it first version, and then, um, like maybe you, [PERSON3] and [PERSON4] should comment on that.Â  So after this is done then at the same time [PERSON1] I will also ask you [PERSON1] and [PERSON3].
(PERSON2) No, no, not require, not require [PERSON1], not require to like only for summarization, ok? (PERSON2) You can just ask them, because eventually, like finally, it depends on how many papers we are getting.
So like we have many good uh contexts, like, for example, from [ORGANIZATION1] only we can have two or more than three or four people.
(PERSON1) I don't know, but [PERSON4] told that today Google doesn't work.
So that is, anyway, I did not thought like, um, like making a share task would be that much challenging.
(PERSON1) Yes, we don't have, we don't, we don't actually have scientific input.
It means to give the participants a totally new task and asked them to make mixed experiment and then compare the results.
(PERSON2) Yeah, I think uh like uh, even if we call it a workshop, but it will be mostly challenge specific.
(PERSON2) Yes, yes, many, me and [PERSON4] we, we addressed at least six to seven people from summarization community.
But feel uh [ORGANIZATION2] is is organizer, so it does not make sense, like someone from [ORGANIZATION1], right? (PERSON2) Yes, I try to figure out what are the other things that we need to take care of.
