 [PERSON4] probably would not want to connect anyway, because says the of his like hearing issues.
(PERSON5) So [PERSON15] proposed that he would test the ASR and the segmenter independently, separately.
Cause the 4 files we do not need any more, but the the the most important part are Antrecorp.
It's 20 minutes in the row and so consecutive is already broken in smaller chunks manually by [PERSON10].
So that there is some inconsistency of names now, and they are is ([PERSON11], [PERSON8] and [PERSON13] and also [PERSON13], ??) and so on.
(PERSON14) Yeah, well well you need, you are sitting into chairs now, as a participant of audible SLT.
Yeah, So this is up to date, and then we have test set, and also consecutive.
(PERSON14) So Austrian, who is Austrian, which person is Austrian, if consequtive [PERSON8] so [PERSON8] is Austrian.
Oh, I see, it's yeah, Antrecorp files with the test are clean all audible cell ties.
And then we will have one more one the right outputs output paths.So this is a I'll now orange the cells that you should try to populate.So this is the starting point for today.
And and then laid I'll also prepared bars or I'll have finally [PERSON10] and [PERSON1] to the path for these files.
Yeah, so, I'll have to leave already but it's important please ask [PERSON1] to - And so from B3 to D16, there we need to list the black versions.So this one the C3 for example, this is already good.So I'll remind this with with green.And this one is unclear.
(PERSON14) Okay, if I have not done that myself then do it tomorrow, okay, yep.
(You for Euros) because [PERSON14] told me to collect test to prepare test the data.
So right now I'm working on 3 languages Polish and Polish, German, Russian.
So [PERSON14] (forrest) ask me to process this Antrecorp test which is an 17 and 18 and 19.
