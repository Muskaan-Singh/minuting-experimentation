 (PERSON9) So, no, it might, it, it might be about 1 P.M.
[LOCATION2] time, I'm not sure, what it is called.
(PERSON2) Like simply said, it's 1 hour from now and 4 days – So, uh, they really take it as a, uh, temporary solution what they have now, uh, for you.
You, you will have to come, uh, for the paperwork and then you can possibly return and, and work remotely.
So, uh, I'm, I, I'm, I fear that the same situation is for [LOCATION2].
(PERSON6) We will also, occasionally check for you and as soon as you can apply for visa, then please go for it.
And then I replied to him, I mean to, to [PERSON5], on Friday and I have no messages from [PERSON5] since last Thursday.
(PERSON2) I will also, maybe run this, uh, translation on CPUs, because there are many CPUs that are now not used, so, just to, uh, make it quicker.
I– in my case, also, I, I, I, don't know, don't know exactly how we can add it or include it right now.
(PERSON4) Yeah, I, I don't know it was, uh, addition idea that I think that we can work on for now until we have new ideas.
Ye–, uh, well but then I think like this, this might be a good, good approach to the, to the task.
