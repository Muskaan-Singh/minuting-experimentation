 No, no, I'm just aligning that link of the web interface, which is already there one in the corrector- (PERSON5): Ye, I am searching I I did hadn't half of the copy of it.
(PERSON8): Okay, Take your time and maybe as you have it just paste it please.
(PERSON4): Ye, ye, so, the thing is like I'm starting the I'm starting the web that how to croll those minutes.
(PERSON4): So it might be in the other range, so the [ORGANIZATION2] script is from 9 to 14 I guess.
Yes, so you can see ah, six six 2011, this is six six 2011.
(PERSON5): Yea, even I wanted to ask the contented would it would it be good for shared task.
(PERSON5): So, what I proposed is that we have the transcript and the reference in the interface.
And then we have very cris example that what is a good summary and what is a bad summary.
(PERSON5): Ye, that's that's that's what [PERSON8] and I discussed that for the drafting of each should be finalized.
(PERSON5): So yea, but [PERSON8] I think we need this in another way also.
(PERSON4): Okay, so that we can have the same set up of what good and bad minute looks like.
We all can annotate a single minute and then we will see based on [PERSON5]'s criteria.
(PERSON5): Yea, so it is it is I think a good idea so we can easily finalize the draft (PERSON4): So [PERSON8] I would like to ask like for currently then we are not going ahead with the alignment thing, right? (PERSON4): And when [PERSON5] need to share the evaluation criteria and we would all would annotate.
(PERSON4): Yea, so I think if we can have like the europarl data with the transcript and the minutes align.
So one thing [PERSON8] so you buy alignment so I'm like getting a little bit confused.
(PERSON8): Ye, ye it seems bigger but I meant just finding minutes for each transcript.
 (PERSON8): Okay, somehow you didn't push us away today so they granted us woth extra time.
