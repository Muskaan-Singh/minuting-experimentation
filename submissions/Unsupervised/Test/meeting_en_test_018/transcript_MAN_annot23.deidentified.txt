 (PERSON6) So, [PERSON7] was sending me me a e-mail that he might be a little bit late.
(PERSON4) But uhm [PERSON7] also wanted to, like properly decide uh [ORGANIZATION3]'s or (the quality) estimation stuff, and so- So [PERSON9] is joining us, right now and uh with [PERSON7], I'm not sure.
(PERSON6) Yeah, like y- ye- [ORGANIZATION4] deadline is uh this- this uh, Sunday.
Uh, also I- I remembered I can also send you a link uh to the [ORGANIZATION2] Calendar.
And then uh we also have uh, some year of [PROJECT6], where um the uh German was translated directly into Czech.
And then there is the HYTER data set, which is 50 Arabic and 50 Chinese sentences and each of these were translatek into English again, trying to create as many uh references as uh uh as possible.
Uh [PERSON2], you- you also didn't receive any reply for the [PERSON10]'s e-mail? (PERSON4) Uh- I don't know, just I feel like [ORGANIZATION7]'s- seriously dropped the ball on- this project.
(PERSON9) Yeah I'm I'm afraid I'm afraid that [PERSON10] will only say that he is starting to hire someone.
(PERSON9) So I'll- I'll write an e-mail to [PERSON10] right now and hopefully something will happen.
(PERSON7) And uh, just today I noticed that the AC- [ORGANIZATION4] deadline uh, was shifted to, October 7th I guess.
Do- do w- do we want to uh participate with something, for example with [PROJECT4], or I don't know.
Uh I think that doing uh also [PROJECT4] demo submission would be uh uh a good thing.
(PERSON7) Okay, because now we are like uh, now we are uh, releasing the pape- or publishing the paper for [PROJECT7], so okay w-, we can maybe somehow uh make uh, a like shorter version of it.
(PERSON7) Okay, so just to recap uh what's going on with that [PROJECT4].
So, [PERSON9] is going to uh write to uh [PERSON10], just to manage things in [ORGANIZATION7], yeah? But we don't need native English speakers, we need uh somebody who doesn't know any Czech or any Estonian.
