 So the plan is will be [ORGANIZATION2] welcome, will be Mary Sorrow, and in-between will be (Python Sorrow) that's excepts sentences for translation from the [ORGANIZATION2] worker.
(PERSON11)  with partial sentences and then will forward the requester onto the [PROJECT2] server yourself.
 And then at some point somehow there will be made a decision that let's move on to the next textfield.
 (PERSON10) That's just whether of presentation if we want to completly replace and use the history, So, so [PERSON7] ehm needs to discuss with [PERSON10] the updates versus history of text uhm text fields.
 (PERSON10) Last time I discuss about it the first prototype presentable should be at the 15th of June.
Do we plan to run any [ORGANIZATION3] workers in [LOCATION1], so especially the ASR the ASRs of English and other things as a fall back solution.
 So they are able to connect to the [ORGANIZATION2] platform and then the whole chat window is flooded with the messages not enough workers available.
 So that's that's why I'm asking this clones of alpha workers to run in [LOCATION1].
(Ty) I only  more worker and now is sexteen or fifteen worker ASR, who are close connected .
So so is good that there that many workers now, so I I actually suggest that we try after this c- .
(PERSON6) Yeah.
I didn't attend the yesterday meeting, but the bug that I mentioning is that sometimes the work, one worker can handle several sessions, but then it's, but then it stocks and it doesn't return any output.
(PERSON7) So, and when you see say several session you mean consecutive ones like one after another.
And then mo- most importantly you need to run it and figure out where the problem is and then the bucket, but- Okay, so, I think it's still too early to solid final lists are in the MT models.
