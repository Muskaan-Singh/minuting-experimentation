PERSON7 and PINDI will do some probing on transformer networks.PERSON7 and PERSON3 are talking about how to improve the tactogrammar.
PERSON7 and PERSON3 want to have a skype call with the people in [LOCATION2] for two weeks.
The attention matrice is a line with particulations and it's chunked down from much attention eh is focused of the first of words data in ee syntactic laytion.
The lower layer zero lenght layer was quite good and for for one subject -  PERSON7 is training about its raise or the dependency trees.
PERSON5 is in location 1 until the 15th December.
He will be taken in the beginning of December.
Two syntactic heads were trained to be similar to the gold trees in order to improve their performance.
They don't need to annotate the syntax when translating, because it's an objective function.
They also report better results improvement in they in they target these two heads like gold syntax.PERSON3 is reworking the manual paper.
PERSON10 is working on the money paper.
PERSON3, PERSON10 and PERSON5 are discussing the differences between multilingual and based multiligual models.
There are three layers to the model: large, small and base.
The large layer didn't capture syntax crash.
The small one didn't but it's just layer just and predict <unintelligible> in tact.
It's to have layers model analyse small layers so it'sPERSON3, PERSON10 and PERSON1 are working on their master thesis.
