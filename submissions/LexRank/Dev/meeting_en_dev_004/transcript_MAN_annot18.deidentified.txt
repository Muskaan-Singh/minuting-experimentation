[PERSON13] Yes, if it is in [LOCATION3].
I will <unintelligible>.
But it´s not, it´s, yeah, it´s in the afternoon so if, if you can on morning?
[PERSON13] To the <unintelligible>.
Yeah, we don´t really now what it will be like.
[PERSON5] Um, yeah like about, um, his paper and I could <unintelligible> some papers <unintelligible>.
[PERSON13] Yeah, I, I have one more paper whitch was not accepted to ACL, um, I, I was working on that in [LOCATION4] and, um, the results are not, um, not very good so maybe I could, I could, I could, um, push it to, push the paper to the, to the [PROJECT8]-, [PROJECT8] so that´s, it´s somewhere.
It could be black box paper as well, so yeah, I, I will decide and I will talk to, with <unintelligible> on [LOCATION4] <unintelligible>, they would like to have this paper in, in [PROJECT8].
[PERSON10] Yes, so this is, this is the last one.
So that it is, so that is it.
[PERSON13] But, but I think that the, the paper, the [LOCATION4] paper could, could go there to the <unintelligible> so, so problem we can, we can do it to Archive and [PROJECT8] so that someone can read it.
[PERSON8] Yeah, um, so -
And, yeah, so now I´m trying to structure the <unintelligible>, yeah, to all the, um, modules chaptures some morfology so what they say, what morfology is captured and how will it is captured and there is no big difference between the individual models so, um.
Yeah, I will to <unintelligible> to some preface, I think it looks nice.
Yeah, I, I, preface to the book?
Maybe, yeah, we will, we will read on the <unintelligible> and then commented.
And but I have only some of the visualisation because only, only some of there were in our experiment with [PERSON8] so I will need to, to generate, um, to get the, get the same or the similar metrices from the, um, from the [PROJECT3] as well so I, I´m planning to, um, to -
[PERSON13] Yeah, it should, maybe the color should be changed because it would be better to have it like the <unintelligible> to be white to that the lines are visible there, um, so let the I will changed it and I will (regenerated) maybe more, more to the on [PROJECT3] as well so could be can compared, um, better.
And I would like to, this is, this is, um, figure about, um, how different types of heads, um, the type propotion in a blue, blue task but this is copied from, from my paper by covered up but I would like to have similar, um, similar, um, graphs for, um, for, for [PROJECT6] and other thigs as well so I, I would like work about days and -
[PERSON8] <unintelligible> in better states probably [PERSON5] can now work with you on the attentions because my chapture is, is a real nice so I think it would be hard to introducing you <unintelligible> now.
So I haven´t continue with this, this week so but I would like to finish it somehow, maybe I will, yeah...
[PERSON13] And, and, yeah, we are in the book.
Um, but, yeah, maybe I don´t ask someone if, if you can, if we don´t manage it by, by the end of June what we should do but, um, I don´t want to do it now because when we know that the deadline is postponed we will not do anything so, um -
[PERSON13] And about that we have to talk with, I will, I will, I will write to, to [PERSON7] to -
[PERSON13] Yeah, so if we have nothing to the book, um, yeah.
[PERSON13] Or it can be, yeah.
[PERSON13] Money you don´t need to have to <unintelligible> and now so it´s not -
[PERSON13] So that it is, the deadline is after the notification of [PROJECT7].
[PERSON13] So that make it, make it faster or if it is, yeah, if it was very good on [PROJECT7] but not accepted, the, the accepted like August automatically to black box.
<unintelligible> is [LOCATION6].
[PERSON13] To, um, submited for [PROJECT4] because [PROJECT4] is only, um, like it´s a conference like that I don´t know what people <unintelligible> will be, um, um, like it will be all from, from all the fields of informatics so maybe they will not understand much of <unintelligible> much discussed if you this, this <unintelligible>.
[PERSON13] They´re writing about so it´s only if you want to go to [LOCATION7] and it´s the other <unintelligible> have but I don´t know maybe it will be virtualised as well so -
[PERSON13] Yeah, it, it make only that you will have one point, um, in [PROJECT1] but it´s -
[PERSON8] Yeah, abstract submission is June 15th so it´s on Monday and then there is one more week for weekend.
[PERSON8] Yeah, so -
[PERSON13] So it is, it is only like, um, <unintelligible> conference.
[PERSON5] Yeah, so -
[PERSON5] Yeah, yeah, if it is -
I <unintelligible>.
[PERSON5] For now I think I will try to [PROJECT4] and, and then <unintelligible> from to, to send where and...
I will need to go trough, trough all the mails I´ve, I´ve get from [ORGANIZATION3] and see what I can do with the, with this money but we can buy something on equipement or I, I -
[PERSON13] So we will be, we can, we can move, transfering money to the, um, um, the salaries but we all, but I don´t know where you can introducing you, um, new people to our project.
[PERSON13] So it <unintelligible>.
[PERSON13] That I don´t <unintelligible>.
So I, I <unintelligible>.
[PERSON13] I don´t know how it will be the next year <unintelligible> get less money because this, this other finished and you -
[PERSON13] Yeah, yeah, I will, I will ask [PERSON2] and money how would be <unintelligible> some reason.
[PERSON13] I, I will need to, yeah, go trough the, the papers and see what is, what is possible.
[PERSON4] What, what [PERSON7] computers it was, um, it was a strange situation because he got a confirmation from, um,[PERSON11] cluster is no, not able to accomodate more [OTHER1] at that time so, so he bought a laptop what, what the strong [OTHER1] that, that was to the region he was allowed to, to buy it from [ORGANIZATION2].
And if somebody doesn´t want to let us in so we should say that, that, yeah, it´s, um, deal with [PERSON7] and [PERSON9].
