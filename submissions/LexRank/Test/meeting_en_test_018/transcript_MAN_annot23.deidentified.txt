Uh.
Uh.
Yeah, so you're preparing the paper for the [PROJECT7], I see.
It appears, that um- this is the big paper and uh <laugh> there's going to be no paper with [ORGANIZATION7], because-
(PERSON6) So- so the [PROJECT7] submission is going to be with uh, collaboration with [ORGANIZATION3], or or not?
But uh I think the k- the big paper is not happening, because there is just no, any data.
Okay so- so yeah.
Uh.
Yeah okay so let's let's keep the [PROJECT5] and [PROJECT4] right now, since [PERSON7] is not here and maybe uh- do we have some updates on the <otherâ€“noise> [PROJECT2]?
I- I saw that uh [ORGANIZATION4] is the next one, so I, I took the uh-
And so it will be interesting to, to check this kind of thing so-
(PERSON9) But I shouldn't be telling this to [PERSON6], because he's <laugh>
(PERSON6) No- no I'm- I'm really starting to write to- this week <laugh>.
And uh it's small in the number of uh sentences, uh that we have.
Uhm but think a-bout which uh composition of the- uh of uh- the data set is the uh the most useful for you.
(PERSON6) Okay, so uh yeah.
Uh it's 3.4?
The daily reports or calls should be also beneficial in a way, that you're more socialized with the, with the rest of the team, or at least with so- some of people.
Uh.
Uh so yeah uh I'm not sure, like since [PERSON7] is still not replying, whether he will make it, uh- <other_noise>
So we had a meeting uh with uh [PERSON8] and uh [PERSON1] on Friday and uh also uh [PERSON12] and the uh-
Uh only that we are formally starting with uh with that thing, and uh they should uh find translators, and uh the overall budget available is lower than we uh we were hoping for, uhm but uh-
(PERSON9) Yeah, so uh so maybe uh just tell them, that I told you that it's- it's proceeding and that uh w- we are essentially waiting for them to tell us the number of people uh and the number of segments we can afford.
(PERSON9) Once we have the number of unique people and the number of segments in total uh that uh we have funding for, uh we can propose th- uh the set of documents, uh to discuss if we are fine with that.
It is mentioned in the document that uh like uh yeah.
(PERSON6) Okay, so so yeah.
Okay so this is the best we can <laugh> do right now.
So uh, yeah.
And that's <laugh> that's it, so <laugh>.
Like uh just just don't don't be uh, depressed, but uh uh-
And uh.
(PERSON4) Well, the the issue is that we already agreed to do, to do the writing and so on.
(PERSON6) Mhm, okay.
(PERSON4) But I don't know what exactly I should write into the paper, because we already had ten people do this experiment, which is five times more than what we already have from [ORGANIZATION7] and-
So, so uh, I don't know [PERSON7], can you can you, just do a quick update for the [PROJECT5]?
(PERSON7) Yeah, so like uh-
Uh.
(PERSON7) Mhm, okay.
(PERSON7) Okay, because now we are like uh, now we are uh, releasing the pape- or publishing the paper for [PROJECT7], so okay w-, we can maybe somehow uh make uh, a like shorter version of it.
(PERSON7) Yeah, but it is it is already enough for the [PROJECT7] paper, like-
Uh I- I uh, I think that that's it for today, right?
(PERSON7) Okay, so just to recap uh what's going on with that [PROJECT4].
So, [PERSON9] is going to uh write to uh [PERSON10], just to manage things in [ORGANIZATION7], yeah?
Yeah, I- I know like I'm really dissatisfied with this and I know that uh, this should be-
(PERSON7) But yeah yeah, I I I'm I agree that uh this is the duty for [ORGANIZATION7] and uh yeah.
(PERSON7) Yeah, but we are the leaders uh of this project and-
(PERSON7) Like and [PERSON4]is leaving or, and uh so-
(PERSON9) Yeah, I I I'm happy to see that [PERSON7] is not as depressed as I understood from what [PERSON4]was saying, so yes, exactly, this is the uh the approach that you should be taking.
So that's uh <laugh>.
(PERSON6) Okay, so- so uh, well we've got that covered, we'll see- see what [PERSON10] will, do.
