And we would like, so it has to be something that we can ASR, and [OTHER2] is the, the best next option, and we will try to rely on the live generated translations into [OTHER4], for example, and we will see how bad the translations will be.
(PERSON8) Yes, but it's, I don't think it's too bad solution, because it's intended for slides, there is usually no, it's, it's not good for videos obviously, there is no way this would work for videos, but it's good for static slides, and the setup that we have on Monday seminars all the time, and, um.
I'll be again inviting people to help, and I was curious, especially about [PERSON6], if he was like successful with his exams, and if he could now work on domain adaptation, so that we could feed in computational linguistics language model for, like [OTHER4] talk on computational linguistics, and if that would be, if we if we could plug this into the into the current setup.
(PERSON8) Yeah, okay.
I, I've sent an email to the <unintelligible>, about the, what I found, so if anyone could look into it, and say something, it would be great.
Yeah, okay, so we'll <unintelligible>, yeah, it's it's something that goes beyond the the time limit that that we have now.
(PERSON8) Okay, yeah, so yeah, I'll have a look at that.
So, is there any chance that you would have some files ready for the Monday talk, or not at all if not that's not a problem, either, but there is all of the semesters are starting, so every Monday there will be some more technical talk in [OTHER4], mostly in [OTHER4] on <unintelligible>
(PERSON8) Yeah, so please get in touch with [PERSON7], I dunno where is [PERSON7] today, I forgot to, uh, I haven't seen him in the office.
(PERSON8) Yeah, okay, thank you.
(PERSON4) Okay, so I have <unintelligible> mostly the work and the <unintelligible>, I have it for [LOCATION2], but <unintelligible> too difficult to modify for [OTHER4], so, um, I <unintelligible>, if I received some domain input sentences, then I could search the database, and return a list of a singular sentence states, and some large focus, and it should also work on word level, so if I give it uh, <unintelligible>, then it will find a sentences that are like <unintelligible>, so it maybe, because I will be in the mountains on the weekend, but I will be back in like Sunday night, so <unintelligible> for the Monday, and then I will be able to provide something, but probably either like Monday morning or Sunday late night, <unintelligible>.
(PERSON8) <unintelligible>
Thank you, so I don't think that <unintelligible> ready and used for this Monday, but it will be very good if you synchronize with [PERSON6], and if you provided this to [PERSON6]
[PERSON6] would use the files that we like find for the speaker, and as soon as we have the the the either you or [PERSON6], well that doesn't matter who does that.
(PERSON4) Okay, okay, so it will be best to if we synchronize with [PERSON6], you can try <unintelligible>, I'm not sure how how, it can be like I just <unintelligible>.
But if you are searching for the domain <unintelligible> the [LOCATION1], <unintelligible>.
That you should get in touch with [PERSON6], because [PERSON6] <unintelligible> some language model data related to my talk on Monday, so it would be great, if you to try to put this to Monday <unintelligible>.
(PERSON4) Okay and <unintelligible>, I have <unintelligible> that <unintelligible>, they mostly <unintelligible> presentation platform and how it could be <unintelligible>, I <unintelligible>.
(PERSON8) Yeah, thank you, okay, so that's from Voj from [PERSON4], and then [PERSON5].
I also made it so that it colors in different colors, depending on the volume, though, the the last problem is that I'm not sure how to stand those thresholds, and I wrote into email to [PERSON7] that that I could do in in like three ways either I could just like.
(PERSON8) Okay, yeah, yeah.
the level, and and as indicated or is calculated by your application, and then sat the threshold, so that they work for this, and if you are running any problem problems just set it to some random value.
So maybe if the output could be a little bit more verbose so, that some number, would appear next to the next to the the image as well, so that when [PERSON7] is observing the session, and he notices that something is too quiet, and or too loud, he could mark down the number, so that he doesn't have to take a screenshot and then.
(PERSON9) The problem is is that, the problem is just that, because it was trained with TPU that, there are some other like, ways of how it, how it saves the models.
(PERSON9) Yeah, that's the problem that that.
So the problem is that that this wasn't trained on [PROJECT1].
(PERSON9) But I had to do it just in <unintelligible>, because of the TPU support, so so most likely I will have to export it as.
(PERSON9) Yeah, well, there is one for <unintelligible> actually, that I could use it's called open neural network exchange format.
(PERSON8) I don't think <unintelligible>, is it?
Yeah, you are right yeah, yeah there is probably, there is probably not a high chance that the architecture [PROJECT1] is precisely the same.
I think that that they they can, it can be safely used if we <unintelligible> serving, which is just <unintelligible>.
So, so.
(PERSON8) Yeah, so that's great news for paraphrasing, like projects, but I don't think there is any way in which we could benefit from that for [PROJECT2], because
So we we don't have uh, the the connection to the the integration of [OTHER3] models, do we?
(PERSON8) Yeah, and see if we, so that's a thing for [PERSON7] again, as we are growing, we still have not collect, obtained any single number from our models, in the in as they are in this setup, but we should get to that in in in the two weeks of February at the latest, so within these two weeks.
(PERSON9) But it is, but it is trained like in [OTHER4] centric way, and and when I evaluated it on [OTHER4], it has much better performance than in the other languages obviously, because it sees [OTHER4] all the time.
(PERSON8) Yeah, that's the paraphrasing, but for [PROJECT2] purposes, simply the send all the various recordings that we have already transcribed, and we don't have translation for that, so we need to polish the data set, but just for.
Yeah, yeah, so we will send you something.
(PERSON8) So, this is something that we want to like bootstrap so what we'll do <unintelligible> of that.
(PERSON8) Are better than the old [ORGANIZATION2] one, I'm not believe that as well, then this is the good model to do the offline translations of all these large data.
So please send the path to all the source files that you have to [PERSON5] and [PERSON5] will apply the models, and we will get the first follow synthetic, very much in domain corpus, across these six main languages, and then redo this also with all the other 30 something languages.
(PERSON7) <unintelligible>
(PERSON8) So is there a way in which you could train it so that it is more similar to the ASR output.
(PERSON7) So that's why how [PERSON10] helped me, <unintelligible> buffer, I will be taking all the text and so that we like, all incoming text will.
(PERSON8) And another question, for what you are training on, because if you are training on correct text, and that's the case, then there is like a domain mismatch of looked again, and a few sentences that [PERSON11] was like saying in his [LOCATION2] presentation.
Like [LOCATION2] and <unintelligible>.
(PERSON4) Okay, okay, yeah, that would be better I think
(PERSON9) I have a quick idea, could we perhaps make just something like, Wikipedia page, or something like that with at least all possible data sets or all possible like you know purposes, so that so that when someone like has a new one, we can always just add it there, so it can be used by everyone else.
(PERSON9) Yeah, okay, okay, because like I, I also have some processed data that I collected, and so, so I could send it somewhere and so on.
So, thank you very much for coming, next I'll email everybody again, at the latest on Wednesday, when are we meeting next week, and there is Doodle <unintelligible>, so please keep that Doodle <unintelligible>, like up to date because the Doodle <unintelligible> applies to regular weekly time, and we will find the date, which time which suits most of you.
