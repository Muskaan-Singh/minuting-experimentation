You are preparing the link into the- (PERSON5): Ye, Ye, Ye No, no, I'm just aligning that link of the web interface, which is already there one in the corrector- (PERSON8): So [PERSON4] we have discussed with [PERSON5] your negotation.
Are there any links that we can see or what?
(PERSON5): Ye I will, I'm just finding it.
(PERSON4): I did with you [PERSON8] for like I have to collect the minutes so- I don't understand this upload thing.
And how to like find what is actually there in the [ORGANIZATION2] corpus and how we do that link with the web.
So.
(PERSON8): Yes, so for each transcript in europarl you can find the minutes.
(PERSON4): Ye (PERSON8): Can you see it?
And here we are so on the web we are within [ORGANIZATION2] website.
(PERSON4): So chapter that is 16 is also like 16.
(PERSON8): What is that?
(PERSON5):Ye this is some paper, they have shown the interface.
So you want to just see that what they are following like the based or is it some kind of the- So they have shown us a snapshot of the interface which they have done for the annotation tool (PERSON8): But what should I do with that?
(PERSON5): Okay, so in the fact-based the figure number ehm.
The interface we haven't shown it- (PERSON8): Okay (PERSON5): It is the based our it is not by base.
But the other paper they it is it is ehm.
(PERSON5): Yea, so I wanted to show you that here itself in on page number- (PERSON8): This blue one, yes?
They have just it is not shown the transcript and the summarisation.
That where they have this summary and transcript which they have put in the web application.
(PERSON5): So I'm this is the interface which can be seen in web application.
And how good is the summary So they have this entire web interface.
(PERSON5): So I just wanted to confirm that is the web base good for us or something else is is.
So you have some papers, you have confirmed fact-based.
(PERSON5): So, what I proposed is that we have the transcript and the reference in the interface.
And we will have the questions for while which the annotators would.
So do you want to do it for all the data.
So that is that that is really like depending on a writer.
So that we can see and we can agree that.
Can we do that?
(PERSON5): Ye, ye, we can do that.
And you can just see to that.
I don't think that would be a good thing but.
(PERSON4): That is that is.
So, once we haven't have that.
We are okay with the interface.
(PERSON5): Ye, that's that's that's what [PERSON8] and I discussed that for the drafting of each should be finalized.
And then you will all please have a look on that.
I'd like to add that it would be that it is very hard work to make these evoluations.
Ye [PERSON5] please also while you put your criterias please also evaluate two minutes- (PERSON5): Hmm, okay (PERSON4): Okay, so that we can have the same set up of what good and bad minute looks like.
(PERSON5): Yea, so it is it is I think a good idea so we can easily finalize the draft (PERSON4): Yes.
(PERSON4): So [PERSON8] I would like to ask like for currently then we are not going ahead with the alignment thing, right?
Yea, I I do not have any progress with the new thing.
(PERSON4): Okay, so can we just <unintelligible> about that.
(PERSON4): Yea, no, I thought the matrix that you that you did.
(PERSON5): Okay, so I maybe link the papers which I implemented.
(PERSON4): Yea, okay.
(PERSON5): Yea, so I did try with our data.
(PERSON4): Yea, so I think if we can have like the europarl data with the transcript and the minutes align.
(PERSON4): So yea, so let's not be (PERSON8): Ye, ye it seems bigger but I meant just finding minutes for each transcript.
I will I will link them in five minutes I think just opening the- (PERSON4): Yea, sure, sure, okay.
