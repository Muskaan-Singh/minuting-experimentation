I, now I, I, I get, got rid off the, like the to do sections at the end of the section so I can figure it all the papers that I want to refer to somewhere.
Um, yeah, cause I don´t know much about it actually but I think we maybe (say) we can just -
So I guess the paper that cited there the [PERSON17] <unintelligible> for the multilinguality this is what we´ll kind of appear there and yeah.
So I opened the paper in Inkscape and I degroup it and I saved just the image into the file and <unintelligible> png.
So I think it <unintelligible> -
[PERSON6] That you cannot do it, hm -
Hm, this is it.
So they, they even no say much more in the original paper actually and I don´t know any other papers, um, on that.
So it shou-, yeah, I think it will be like one paragraph or something.
[PERSON14] Um, it, it is -
[PERSON21] This is it.
[PERSON21] Yeah, so, so yeah.
So if it is not <unintelligible> nothing it will be OK.
Yeah, so...
[PERSON14] The other some like pdf and I think so I, I (need) to, um...
[PERSON14] Um, so, so 5.2 and 5.3.
[PERSON14] Um, um, yeah, and this is -
And yeah, then there´s this 3.2 which I´m not sure if it belongs here or what to do with it but I think we can decide that at the end.
I, I promised that I will, I will, I would, I will move fast of my introduction of my chapture to here as well because these, these are, these two texts are very, very similar.
[PERSON14] Um, yeah, this is 3.1.
So in the end the only things left for the to does is the, is -
[PERSON24] But yeah, also I think this is -
Other then that I don´t need the figure when this figure is here so I delete it.
[PERSON14] <unintelligible> my part write your text, um, like 4.2 or 4.3 and then you can, you can make this figure, um, better.
Yeah, at these they should be there but they, they might ugly or we, we need to know what is there, what is in the figure.
[PERSON14] No if the figure is ugly or not and then -
So if it, if we have it in pdf and not it pgf, it´s no problem I think.
[PERSON14] If only (the font) change and the, the, the picture will be same only the nicer and then I´m sure it´s OK.
So yeah.
So first, yeah, the text and <unintelligible> is there.
So yeah.
[PERSON20] Yeah, but at least you can replot it so it, so it has the same font as the book.
And yeah, if I don´t see the, the green lines and I don´t see that it is really done in the comment I will, I will, I don´t know.
So yeah, so they have like the -
But, but, um, I think if we have like, like one <unintelligible> reviewer from, from [LOCATION1], it´s OK.
[PERSON14] It would be at least abstract or I don´t know if I ask only, OK, we will have a book with <unintelligible> about -
[PERSON20] And there are no rules, um, it, in the books series that we should have a summary and, and summary in Czech and something like that.
But I don´t think it says more about what should be in the summary or, or so.
[PERSON14] So it, yeah.
So it, I think it it maybe, yeah.
It is not like <unintelligible> or something.
So it is, it is OK.
[PERSON14] Yeah, but this is, this is, yeah, this is in the table.
[PERSON14] So I, I <unintelligible> that.
The, um...
So yeah.
I, I´m not registered for ACL anyway and I didn´t understand much like how it´s really works and I didn´t have time to investigate it so I´m just waiting so if somebody else like prepares it for me and says me, sit here and watch this and -
So it won´t be like -
[PERSON6] I think it should work (badly) if you´re here and somebody else also wants to watch the same thing and he´s registered which I don´t know if, if it will be true.
I think that´s kind of the plan but, um, yeah.
