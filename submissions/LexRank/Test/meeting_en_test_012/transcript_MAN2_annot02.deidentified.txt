There is nothing that I would know about that we need to discuss uh, like in in in a very big detail,ehm.
So if we have [PERSON10] on the call.
So [PERSON10] are you on the call?
And we also,do we have [PERSON11] Here are not yet.
(PERSON11) Yeah, I'm here,I'm here with <unintelligible>
So this Python based <unintelligible> which would I do preproccessing and he can handly many, yeah, not so well the logic, where need to be dealing with partial sentences, but -
(PERSON11) Okay, yes and also the <unintelligible> empty worker ehm.
So.
And and that's it.
One thing that I would still like to know [PERSON11], is the handling of timestamps.
and the the limitation with this approach is that we can handle only like one single timestamp at the beginning and would be the end of the segment.
So the only timestamps that we have are the beginnig and end of the sentence or <unintelligible>.
So, the -.
It will be a replacing the content of the of the textfield with with the new messages.
so in other words yes part of the message that the presentation of platform is receiving is an indicator, whether this is an update.
That' -
I think we need to discuss this again a <laugh> fresh call.
But we will let you know if if we see something like that.
I know it's realy uhm <laugh> close to our deadline, but this is the only information I have that <unintelligible>.
(PERSON10) Probably the development team <unintelligible> have something close to be fine advertial to use as prototype, but we can have some working maybe for <unintelligible>.
(PERSON7) Yeah, okay.
[PERSON1], would you ehm would you have any idea, if if this is easy to do of interest and useful.
And and so on?
It will we have the platform.
I will have the <unintelligible> and whether we can start I think it maybe ok.
And (it be) can view some no <unintelligible> voice and <unintelligible> somewhere I think it is okay we also <unintelligible> other things.
(PERSON7) Yeah, okay.
so, yeah, some <unintelligible> we stand when we need more worker I think we have to stop limit number workers.
like we have the.
So in in the long-term, it would be useful to have this image spread out for the various reasons that you mentioned, for the uh workshop itself we should be good.
So I think that we we should be fine relying on, but that's please talk to [PERSON3], what he thinks, because in some early stage we discuss that for just for a backup purposes.
Yes, [PERSON2], was that you?
I didn't attend the yesterday meeting, but the bug that I mentioning is that sometimes the work, one worker can handle several sessions, but then it's, but then it stocks and it doesn't return any output.
So.
I will <unintelligible> us, but yesterday so yeah I don't know what is happening there, because we <unintelligible> when I do know what <unintelligible>prophones it was able to handling several sessions.
And that <unintelligible> I think it in one sentence it ehm it yeah output <unintelligible> and  I can't <unintelligible>  fancy <unintelligible> call but it <unintelligible> it was in call,
I think I--
this is a <unintelligible> I think I had to <unintelligible> information and then <unintelligible> maybe I can hopefully I can see the one simply wrong come from-
If there is anything we can do in order to help you the publing the problem, we stand us careful <unintelligible> the mediator <unintelligible> to test just your worker for some-
Yeah, so this is from [PERSON6].
So so is it okay for everyone?
(PERSON6) Yes, it's it's it's also.
It's the same as in the sample and it didn't for for me this week.
So.
So.
(PERSON6) Yeah, okay.
So I will,
(PERSON7) Yeah, okay.
You can try launching it in the meantime yourself, if it works for you, if you are all Windows already.
And uh if you don't connect to [ORGANIZATION3].
