So, what it
Let's just think that uh, we already need it really working in well tested, uh,at the end of June.
(PERSON4) Okay, yes, so Monday, at nine, or ten or as you wish.
So.
I, yeah I think I know what I need to do.
yeah, we have [PERSON2].
One reason is that we don't have the time to to fix the cashing client,
This is where the segmentation worker has decided to to end the sentence, right?
If you want to see right ASR output I'm not sure if <unintelligible> you will have to request the unsegmented text.
(PERSON4) So.
if you yes,
So.
Is it.
But I think that is what <unintelligible>, yes.
I have, I have no idea
Is that is that correct [PERSON2]?
(PERSON4) Yeah, so I would.
I think that this is something that [ORGANIZATION1] needs to investigate and and improve the the segmentation worker so that it emits the timestamps
So the problem is that if we have from these.
then we we are not uhm,
So this is this is important for [PERSON1].
So there is,
Okay, do we have?
It is it is working,
I'm, I'm not sure.
If you decide that you don't want to do any ASR adaptation to the text,
We can skip ASR if we don't have it.
And we can have the ASR from, uh, from German,
And and we are,
Uh, and the <unintelligible>
So.
Yeah, [PERSON2] is  empty that's on a German to English,
and then I would indeed ehm rely on the [ORGANIZATION3]  platform to do to do the pipoting.
I don't think that the the the <unintelligible> that should work,
(PERSON4) Yeah, from English for ehm <other_yawn>.
That's the,
This the German ASR this one.
and then so on.
(PERSON2) Yeah, so would I on this very most important thing would be text to speech on models one speaker.
But I don't think that it would be <unintelligible> data at all.
(PERSON4) So,
So this is this is something that you are probably already doing so uhm for this.
So.
Okay, so we will let you know uh the next week,
and so on.
() I do.
then [ORGANIZATION1] would know which worker is it.
this is this is to be-
So I 'm-
and then we <unintelligible>.
