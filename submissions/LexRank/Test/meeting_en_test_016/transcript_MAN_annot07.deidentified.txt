(PERSON3) <unintelligible> it is [PERSON14].
(PERSON12) That's okay, I like it, it's fine.
(PERSON12) So but I don't know <unintelligible>.
(PERSON18) I can hear you guys properly, but lower clear, but - (PERSON12) Yeah, [PERSON21] is guess I don't know what <unintelligible> <another-language> (PERSON18) He should be there.
(PERSON18) Yeah, I cannot see you, but I can hear you.
And there is - Okay, there is also [PERSON13].
So I hope that all okay with that been recorded and and actually we would like to release this publicly, but with some delay of like this is a so this is not longer interesting.
And there is a good point, we will send you a link to google form, where you will fill in, that you agree, what this <unintelligible> to be used and there you can specify the limit,what <unintelligible>would like this-which you require to be, em, to be followed before the data is released.
So the point of the call is to make sure,that people know, what others are doing, and they nicely, well like a collaborate, in the sense that no work is done twice.
And so the - So, the - So right now,I would like everybody to go like one by one and summarize in a minute or 2, what you have been working on this week.
So there is the again, university open day, next Wednesday, for which we are doing domain adaptationand then there will be on the 12th of February a dry run of the workshop,that we are going to give for the [ORGANIZATION4] congress.
So this is important for you [PERSON13].
There will be one more of session,and then there will be one more dry run.
(PERSON3) So, exactly like I I I lost some I do not do that.
Yeah, so,<unintelligible> I've to be <unintelligible> that the work is not duplicated.
(PERSON3) Okay, so, I <unintelligible>.
<other_cough> (PERSON12) So now we can <unintelligible>[PERSON20].
So that people, we do not have [PERSON19] and unsure if [PERSON21], are you on the call or not?
(PERSON12) So is it - ?
But what what I'm proposing is, that not you, but [PERSON23] would do this.
(PERSON4) Okay, so now, I'm working on the framework or for example test set for evaluation of simultaneous translation.
So that is that is the immediate help, that that your work will will provide to the to the [ORGANIZATION4] Congress.
Yes, it's could be caused after start, which and I can have a- <unintelligible> which can I have a meeting with [PERSON14], and we can test everything <unintelligible> so.
(PERSON3) Can [PERSON10] and all of <unintelligible>?
(PERSON12) Yeah, so the next one is [PERSON15].
So I have I have already shared with with [PERSON22] and [PERSON5] and [PERSON23] to <unintelligible>.
(PERSON11) It' a <unintelligible> the name of this <unintelligible>.
It's a <unintelligible>.
Can you - ?
(PERSON12) Yeah, so I think, now it is very important, that you and [PERSON15] will synchronize on the thing tools because both's you and [PERSON15] need to convert all the many file formats, especially PDFs, that are hard to process <unintelligible>.
And you both have some tools for that and you also, both of you need to convert it to corpus styles.
And if it's parallel text, then - That's that is not for you [PERSON13], but that would be for [PERSON15] to aline in that <unintelligible> more sentences and so on.
[PERSON13] and I don't know, what [PERSON15] use - (PERSON11) I use <unintelligible> for this <unintelligible>.
(PERSON12)Yeah, I don't I don't - So so yes, so simply - (PERSON11) I've been- I have already sent two PDF files - (PERSON12) Uhm.
(PERSON11) to you and - (PERSON12) Yeah.
(PERSON12) Yeah, okay, so It could be language dependent.
(PERSON11) Yes - (PERSON12) All they can be run - (PERSON11) And anyone - (PERSON12) Yeah, yeah, okay, that's good.
Yeah, it's it's not only needed, it is it's that what [PERSON15] knows, can help you with your bachelor thesis.
<unintelligible> <unintelligible> one plan for <unintelligible> was the <unintelligible> current of the <unintelligible>.
So so right now, in the pipeline we use Czech to English by [PERSON16].
We need to know what we are using.
And we need to know, which one of them is is the best.
Which on the - Well, we don't have - That's it.
(PERSON3) It's okay.
(PERSON3) No, I - I I I I haven't I actually have have I haven't open the access <unintelligible>.
So I 'm the a - At least, and maybe it is not totally <unintelligible> of you, but it's clearing my head, what we should should try with the - <unintelligible> translation before this Wednesday.
I would like to use some in-domain data from - Like European data to train the segmenter, like English and Czech segmenter and use [PERSON10]'s evaluation tool to see, how they are doing.
The  the - In <unintelligible>  to the models, we have <unintelligible> from Czech <unintelligible>.
(PERSON3) I <unintelligible> and - (PERSON4) Yes.
And if I can get the first amount of data and after that, after the some is more test, I think, that the tool is ready and you can use it.
