(PERSON1) So you are.
Uh.
So I 'll do for like one folder, and then they will do it for the rest.
(PERSON1) Mhm (PERSON3) So I, I was doing it it now, just before this call.
(PERSON1) Uh and uh.
Is that.
(PERSON1) Yeah, uh, uh, also please be in touch with [PERSON12].
(PERSON1) So, uh, that is uh, uh, I, don't think that is needed.
It is.
That is, uh, that is good.
I think for some of them, we are calculating exactly the way we should do if you see the code?
Just I will see all of your things, and I will check the code, and we will answer everything in detail in one email to you.
Yes, it is.
Uh, let us move on to, yeah, uh, the, uh, the idea that I have, uh, discussed yesterday, but [ORGANIZATION4] is not too keen on that.
Uh, because you.
And, yeah, so that's that.
And, uh, yes, and uh, so, and then the second item you have in your list [PERSON7].
You and [PERSON9], you and [PERSON9] if you could, uh, um, could come up with the strategy, like the set of things that we want to offer and that we want to ask for.
Uh, and so.
I I I I I don't know what's my status.
(PERSON1) Yeah, this is also for for [PERSON3].
(PERSON1) Yeah, so [PERSON16] is the last person, uh, mentioned in the uh, uh, uh, in in the in the report.
Uh, you are.
And, uh, I have, uh, a job running on the cluster that is, uh, constantly, uh, rewriting, uh, new versions of, of, each, text, and, uh, it, is, it.
So, uh, -.
And now I would like to talk to uh, uh, [PERSON6] and of course [PERSON8].
<unintelligible> (PERSON1) Uh, yes, but this is not the same as what I'm asking for.
Uh, the uh problem I see there is, uh, that uh, the alignment information between set and "gezacht" would bring the early time stamp of the "said" to the late part.
Given the, uh, current max, uh, and [PROJECT15], uh, uh, there it would actually be okay.
(PERSON1) Yes, so that that is good.
Uh.
(PERSON1) Uh, my question on [PERSON8] and you is now, if we if you are able to, uh, come up with an example so that we would actually replace the.
So, uh, I don't, know if you have uh, anywhere in your data, uh, uh, uh, some such example.
So if you could search for a similar simple sentence, uh, that, that, has, this, uh, alignment, uh, that that would be useful.
So, [PERSON8], if if you could look for examples like the one in the [PROJECT9] case, that would be great.
Uh, uh.
That is, that is good.
(PERSON1) Yes, so so please have a look at it.
<laugh> Uh, so so what you think if we, uh, if we really [PERSON15]ed the simple calculation to something which is based only on the C segment and the number of characters?.
Oh, that is because it is proportional in the number of words.
I'll.
It is not simple, but it is based on that formula.
Uh, like that.
Uh, that would be, uh, better, uh, there will be, uh, one that would show the alignment, (PERSON6) Just one more thing [PERSON1].
(PERSON1) The the [PROJECT9]'s?
That is why I do not see that.
<unintelligible> And with this, you should, uh, uh.
(PERSON1) Are you not?
You are.
(PERSON1) Yeah, so that that should be good.
