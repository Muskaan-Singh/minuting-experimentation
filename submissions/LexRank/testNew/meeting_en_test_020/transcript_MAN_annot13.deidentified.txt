(PERSON2) Yeah, I was just going to message him that <unintelligible> are we meeting today or not?
(PERSON2) Yes, I am so <unintelligible> you are usually there on time.
I do not know what is that.
Ah, but the thing is that we have to do much like almost double work with this.
Is it so, or did I said yes?
And, uh, then, like, uh, [ORGANIZATION4], will only be there.
(PERSON3)Yeah, there are.
(PERSON3) Yeah, um, we don't have any option right now.
If we do not get in [ORGANIZATION5] like, do we have some other option as well after [ORGANIZATION5] (PERSON3) We have to go on trying, we have to go for [ORGANIZATION10].
But the thing is that the proposal for a [ORGANIZATION16] workshop this year is over.
Uh, like, uh, it's better that if we get either of the two, um, [ORGANIZATION5] or [ORGANIZATION4].
(PERSON3) The only the only <unintelligible> that I'm finding now is, going with [ORGANIZATION4] is like they will not allow us a space in the proceedings, which may, uh, deter some of the participants.
Like, um, like, I am not sure that how much, how much they will be excited to publish a paper in [PROJECT2] or [ORGANIZATION9] is a big no.
What I can understand is the last time that that differ-.
Then only we can submit, uh, the the workshop of proposal.
So.
Just, uh, like we have to manage this submission and do our thing.
(PERSON3) Yes, yeah, but it, but it means double work.
(PERSON1) Yes I understand, but you are very good.
(PERSON3) <laugh> Yeah, okay, uh.
Okay, uh, so , um, uh, like ,uh.
For like, for um like, for all of us, to submit to the [ORGANIZATION12] workshop administration portal.
(PERSON3)  So we, we have to take a membership to submit the proposal.
(PERSON1) Yeah, yes, I think it's not a problem at all.
Interesting.. (PERSON1) Yeah, it is really big work all of it.
(PERSON3) And and, uh, another thing, uh, [PERSON1] so ,uh, can you tell us a bit more about [ORGANIZATION8]?
(PERSON3) The [ORGANIZATION8].
(PERSON2) Oh, yeah, yeah, okay, mhm.
(PERSON3) So is this?
(PERSON3) So do you think that like, uh, the participants would be interested, uh, for a publication in this, in this journal?
I know I have, uh, in in like in my, uh, research duration.
(PERSON3) [PERSON4] is there so that is good.
So I think, uh, this would be easy for us, like if we have to do [ORGANIZATION8].
Because, you know, like, uh, to a new person, um, they would probably go for where it is indexed.
(PERSON3) So in [ORGANIZATION17] it is not indexed.
So one good thing for, uh, going for <unintelligible> and would be,  uh, if we go for <unintelligible> , uh, the proceedings would be indexed with [ORGANIZATION6] anthology.
Okay, so it is indexed in [ORGANIZATION7].
(PERSON2) Yeah, and it will be like <unintelligible>.
But I think if we are to do it [PERSON4] will take care of that.
So, but [ORGANIZATION9] is is no, because, yeah, it.
But I 'm not sure that if they will charge for that.
Okay, maybe we can ask [PERSON4] I think about this.
But I think it would also be indexed in others like <unintelligible> or something.
(PERSON3) Of [PROJECT4] okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And, uh, it is uh indexed by <unintelligible> Directly <unintelligible> (PERSON3) Mhm, okay, uh, you checked it?
Um, but I have to ask like we can, uh, uh, we can also do it as part of the <unintelligible> forum.
So we have to revise this and list down the thing that we need to do for, uh, the satellite event.
Uh, I am sorry that I can't help you on this stage so I really, I have been-.
I will be glad to read the proposal and to, uh, to write some chapters to the proposal, so-.
The only thing is, we have to do double work, ah, that is the thing.
