(PERSON1) Yes , how are you?
So.
(PERSON2) Ok, so [PERSON1] I was like looking through the task that we need to do.
As specifically I need to do very quickly for the like for the workshop proposal.
That what, what we have to do very quickly is we have to uh set up the website now.
And he reverted to me back with a link and say that you can do it there.
I do not know, like how much it time will take to do with the [ORGANIZATION1] website?
So I have to see, but if it is, if it is tough, I would not do.
<unintelligible> do it in Github and do it very quickly.
So one thing is setting up the website, but the website should have, uh, the content like, ah, the call for participations.
(PERSON1) So the website of Ah, the <unintelligible>, of the, of the special event.
Like, let me write it first version, and then, um, like maybe you, [PERSON3] and [PERSON4] should comment on that.
(PERSON1) Of course we will comment on that, yes.
So.
Yeah, so I will share with both of you a <unintelligible> e-mail for that we will resending to people we know and we want to-
So that's it.
And then we can invite more people based on how many papers we are getting, okay?
So that is <unintelligible>  requirement, but for in the website we have to show at least, I will say approximately around more than 20 people in the program committee.
And yeah.
I do not know.
Uh so the thing is like a for the website we need this thing uh to be ready.
And uh like uh we have to have the membership <unintelligible>.
So, he is yet to respond back that we should do the individual membership, or we should do institutional membership so that we have to know what to do.
And yes.
(PERSON2) Yeah, so we have to also like get the <unintelligible> membership right.
(PERSON1) Aha, okay, I see on my <unintelligible>, ok.
So we are going to like make that uh similar to them.
(PERSON2) Yes and.
Yeah, I think that is it.
And uh maybe like uh, I will also copy on to it so that he can also invite some more people into the program committee.
Okay, so this is it.
Because, you know, like um, usually in workshop, like we used to have a big organizing committee, and some people are from <unintelligible>.
(PERSON2) Yeah, the actually, like we are also doing uh some workshops with <unintelligible>.
Uh for that.
And also a bit on writing the paper uh for that uh, but I did not like, um, <unintelligible> share task I guess it there is so many things that we need to take care of.
(PERSON1) Yes, we don't have, we don't, we don't actually have scientific input.
(PERSON2) Yes and I believe, like if to make it a workshop we definitely need at least one or two people who have a background in summarization.
(PERSON2) Yeah, I think uh like uh, even if we call it a workshop, but it will be mostly challenge specific.
But it is also actually not a workshop it's a satellite event.
(PERSON1) Yes, let's not call it a workshop.
(PERSON2) And for the like <unintelligible> speakers also like we have to invite some <unintelligible> for the input.
Because uh we have <unintelligible> to some like prominent people in summarization.
(PERSON2) But the thing is that we <unintelligible> to like the like what unquote very famous people from some relation who were like, you know.
(PERSON2) No, I 'm going to ask him to be a part of the program committee because he declined to be a part of the organizing committee.
I do not think so.
(PERSON1) Hm, I do not know.
Actually I do not know about senior people for just summarization.
(PERSON1) Ok, let <unintelligible>, write him an e-mail, yes.
(PERSON2) Ok, so I will do that.
(PERSON2) Yeah, <unintelligible>, ok, bye.
