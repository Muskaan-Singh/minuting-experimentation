So, so [PERSON3], I think we need to have a separate call with you and [PERSON2].
[PERSON3] and [PERSON2]?
Ah, and, ah, the one of the biggest thing is that [PERSON10] is leaving, which is listed at the end of the, at the end of the, of the notes for today's call uh.
Ah, [PERSON11]?
Yeah, so I've, have started, but I think I never finished an email to you, because you have reminded [PERSON4] that your, ah, profanity filtering is not yet integrated.
Ah, ah.
I think it's better if, ah, [PERSON4] explains to, ah, to [PERSON11] how to do it.
(PERSON4) Yeah, yeah, that that's also uh very well.
Yeah, you are, ah, ah, so [PERSON4], you have the call with, ah, [PERSON10] later today.

So that's -.
So that is, ah, that was the, ah, like news and and work that is being put on you, because [PERSON10] will be leaving.
So, ah, [PERSON4], this is this is mainly on you and also on [PERSON5] and and [PERSON17].
So, ah, yeah.
