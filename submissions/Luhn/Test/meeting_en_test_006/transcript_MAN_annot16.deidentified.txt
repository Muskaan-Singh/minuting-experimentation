You are preparing the link into the- (PERSON5): Ye, Ye, Ye No, no, I'm just aligning that link of the web interface, which is already there one in the corrector- (PERSON8): So [PERSON4] we have discussed with [PERSON5] your negotation.
But they are not fully ready yet so as far as they will be ready she will share it with us.
(PERSON4): Are there any links to that of the- Ye, for the manual evaluation thing.
(PERSON5): Ye, I am searching I I did hadn't half of the copy of it.
(PERSON8): Okay, Take your time and maybe as you have it just paste it please.
(PERSON4): I did with you [PERSON8] for like I have to collect the minutes so- I don't understand this upload thing.
(PERSON4): Ye, ye, so, the thing is like I'm starting the I'm starting the web that how to croll those minutes.
And how to like find what is actually there in the [ORGANIZATION2] corpus and how we do that link with the web.
(PERSON4): I just want to know a few things from you regarding that europarl website maybe you can guide me.
(PERSON8): Ye, so if I follow the link I may open this search for minutes, here's minutes, and here's a search.
And the name could be from if you go to the data, europarl data.
(PERSON4): So it might be in the other range, so the [ORGANIZATION2] script is from 9 to 14 I guess.
I don't know if this website has gotten index of the minutes just like it had for the transcripts.
So you want to just see that what they are following like the based or is it some kind of the- So they have shown us a snapshot of the interface which they have done for the annotation tool (PERSON8): But what should I do with that?
The interface we haven't shown it- (PERSON8): Okay (PERSON5): It is the based our it is not by base.
(PERSON5): Yea, so I wanted to show you that here itself in on page number- (PERSON8): This blue one, yes?
But this is just a web application which they have shown the snapshot.
That where they have this summary and transcript which they have put in the web application.
(PERSON5): So I and if you see to like after the references can you just go after the references?
So I just wanted to show you how how what kind of people- What kind of manually valuation people are performing for the summarisation systems.
(PERSON5): So I just wanted to confirm that is the web base good for us or something else is is.
(PERSON5): Yea, even I wanted to ask the contented would it would it be good for shared task.
Because I think the annotators will be able to evaluate it in in a better way.
(PERSON5): So, what I proposed is that we have the transcript and the reference in the interface.
So the annotators do not have to compute each and- Because there are so many minutes and the ones which are generated.
And that's what I was asking that building an interface would be a good thing.
And then we have very cris example that what is a good summary and what is a bad summary.
(PERSON5): Ye, that's that's that's what [PERSON8] and I discussed that for the drafting of each should be finalized.
When you start the manual evaluation question there or maybe is that you are suggesting.
Okay so I will send the- (PERSON4): So as I underst- Understand so the coherence with the read ability and all these scores.
I'd like to add that it would be that it is very hard work to make these evoluations.
Ye [PERSON5] please also while you put your criterias please also evaluate two minutes- (PERSON5): Hmm, okay (PERSON4): Okay, so that we can have the same set up of what good and bad minute looks like.
(PERSON8): So you want two different- (PERSON5): Yea two small small minutes so that I can evaluate based on the measures.
(PERSON8): Yes I will- (PERSON4): Maybe we all can- (PERSON5): This is a good thing- (PERSON4): Maybe we all can do like.
We all can annotate a single minute and then we will see based on [PERSON5]'s criteria.
Or audience criteria with judgement we all <unintelligible>- (PERSON8): So we all three we will judge not draft the minutes.
(PERSON5): Yea, so it is it is I think a good idea so we can easily finalize the draft (PERSON4): Yes.
(PERSON4): So [PERSON8] I would like to ask like for currently then we are not going ahead with the alignment thing, right?
Yea, I think for the first shared task I would like absolutely keep everything as simple as possible.
What are the pr- (PERSON5): So some eval and the one was the another paper <unintelligible>.
So- (PERSON4): So on our paper do you have any figures that how the matrix work.
(PERSON4): And when [PERSON5] need to share the evaluation criteria and we would all would annotate.
(PERSON4): Yea, so I think if we can have like the europarl data with the transcript and the minutes align.
And the minutes are also available and if they are- Even automatically extractable it may have sense to extract all the meetings that are available.
So you mean the europarl- Okay, okay so you mean that- (PERSON8): So not just this 6 years but all the years.
(PERSON8): Yes, so to find for each meeting- (PERSON4): Okay, because for- (PERSON8): Each transcript finds its minutes this is the- (PERSON4): The minutes, yes.
Because I did know we were talking about alignments between the transcript and- (PERSON8): No, no, it's different.
(PERSON4): So yea, so let's not be (PERSON8): Ye, ye it seems bigger but I meant just finding minutes for each transcript.
And [PERSON5] and please also send the automatic evaluation that the paper of <unintelligible> want to.
I will I will link them in five minutes I think just opening the- (PERSON4): Yea, sure, sure, okay.
