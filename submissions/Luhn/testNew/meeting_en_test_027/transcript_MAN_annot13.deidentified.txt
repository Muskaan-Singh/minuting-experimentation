So [PERSON2]  you or you said that, you would be very busy and you could- Uh, like, is there anything you can help with or, uh, or, uh-.
Mm, it, it, could, be, any, data preparation, like, downloading for, uh, some, some, domain data you know, for the two, uh, events, or, or, something, like that.
So I will see where can we plug our bear ringers and actually record the sound, uh, um, on the, uh, on site.
And I 'm just checking if [PERSON5] would be available as a back-up person in case of whatever I get sick, or something like that.
And, like, the more important and still persisting topic to to work on is the ladder climbing and I've suggested here uh, in the uh, uh, in the uh, paragraph for [PERSON3], uh, that we could use simple HTML tables that would be auto generated, and that would grow.
Or what you could even do, is to have a full, uh, Git check out, uh, directly located in this public HTML or simling from that public HTML.
So this, this would be useful, especially for people outside of [ORGANIZATION3] such as, [ORGANIZATION4], uhm, we know they have like- The performance was was bad for some of the files and they could directly, uh, browse it on the web.
So if this is up to you to set it up so that it is like user friendly and and easy and easy to follow.
And then I have some project reports to do, and I'm starting to gather documents, ah, like, or links to the documents, not the documents themselves yet, uh, for the two sessions.
Like, what is missing, and what is, um, uh, what, you, were, happy, about, and, what you were unhappy about, when doing D one point five and D six point three.
So I guess we had a proposed that if there are some lines which are coming from, uh, [PROJECT5] and we want to remove it.
And then, uh, as observations, uh, uh, of some D one point five empty, six point, uh, three preparation.
Uh, and here have an explicit list of names and, uh, terms, uh, that we, uh, do want to appear in the output.
Uh, so this would be the rare, uh, words, uh, eval for [PROJECT10] and then from [PROJECT2] we are also likely to get some dictionary.
And [PERSON3] could I ask you to to revise the [PROJECT8] domain and creates such a dictionary by looking at the outputs and what is missing in the outputs.
So like short listing, uh, listing the words that we do like, and we do not like in the [PROJECT8] domain.
Okay, uh, so uh, what I miss still, and what should belong to the ladder climbing and the regular reports is [PROJECT6] style of evaluation.
But, uh, get in touch with [PERSON13] and get some delay scores for some of the files from the [PROJECT1] test set.
So, uh, [PERSON3] please prepare for, uh, for the, uh, Wednesday call with, uh, like, uh, other partners by, uh, getting [PROJECT6] scores delay plus [PROJECT12], uh,  on one of the IW[PROJECT6] Dev, uh, files or uh other, uh, [PROJECT8] domain files.
The plan and the goal is, of course, to put this into the regularly produced tables, but now do it just for one file.
So you see, that like, it's is despite, it seems simple, it actually takes time, and we need to work this way.
And I, uh, for the continuous, uh evaluation, for the ladder climbing I really do want to have tha, uh, uh, um, these observations being gathered like throughout the weeks and not for the deadline.
And uh, uh, like the presentation of that is also important, and we need to do it way before the deadline is approaching.
So hopefully we will be more likely with, uh, like, time allocation for this, and and hopefully it will be less, uh, stressful.
For both of the sessions, [PROJECT2] and [PROJECT3] I do already want to choose the system the the pipeline from some choices, and this has to be based on some numbers.
(PERSON3) <unintelligible> (PERSON1) You will need to be in touch with [PERSON7], as you said, uh, because we need to revive, uh, the
So the question is, uh, which data set we want to use, or whether we want to use more datasets.
So the the goal is to have the baseline, and then to do the, uh, uh, the word uh, cutting thing.
It would not be good, uh, it would be good for comparison purposes, but it would not be good as a system for deployment.
And, uh, so when I said that [PERSON16] is owing us the list of [PROJECT14] data and other links, they actually have already provided these, uh, links in some way.
(PERSON2) Uh, like, in building a non native speech, uh, automated system, for tor some languages, as a part of my, as a part of the masters thesis.
(PERSON2) So I mean, I think the sooner I get started working on it the sooner I will be able to I, I will be able to build the- Uh, I I do not know, because I haven't done this in the past.
So, once, uh, once, I, I, I, go through that, then I think, uh, me a [PERSON4] can decide on when to have a call, uh, with [PERSON7].
So because I m actually also like to work on the non native speakers so of it is actually, uh, uh, one part of my, uh, uh, of my thesis.
Uh, but if I understand it correctly you you would like to do this model using [PROJECT4] <unintelligible> (PERSON2) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Or if you did, then maybe we could include him as well in the call, so that essentially he will also be training [PROJECT5] systems if he is to replace [PERSON7].
It in works in online mode, with three seconds delay, and I 'm going to integrate it into the mediator and create one s simple start up script to increase control so anyone can use it.
And then I'm going to pass it to [PERSON2] or anyone who can train other model the same way as me.
And and and class, you can see the silence, Czech, German, English, and then I will let on the others how they want to use it, in, the, pipeline.
Uh, if we have this tool, we need to ship the audio, uh, to multiple, um, uh, [PROJECT5], uh, or, multiple, uh, workers, in, the, directory.
<other_noise> So we need like, uh, filters for the [PROJECT5]s so the [PROJECT5] is silent if' it's the wrong language and it, uh, it, it is the recognized text if it is the correct language.
Another set up would be that, the same sound is shipped to [PROJECT5] and this language checker and, uh, that already, like this language checker is essentially a a part of the [PROJECT5] silencing the [PROJECT5] if it is the wrong language.
So, we need to figure out, which way, um, uh, is of integrating the language ID is the best for our purposes.
Ideally, uh, uh, I think that uh, the, the, least, uh, like, management, confusion, and, and, so on would arise if our [PROJECT10] models were multilingual.
Ah, so, we would have this multi langue- multilingual, multiple [PROJECT5] at the beginning all going into English and then from the English would go into all of the languages.
Uh, and, uh, I think that we should have multi lingual, uh, [PROJECT10] models and either multi lingual [PROJECT5] or multiple [PROJECT5] with this language ID all feeding into the same multi lingual [PROJECT10] and then this [PROJECT10] producing English.
Uh, I don't think, it, should deteriorate too much if it's if it's, uh, three languages, uh, at the, uh at the beginning.
But if your data is more available through English then it's it's better to go through English or synthetise the uh the data for the direct language pair.
In, the middle of the year so, uh, probably we should start meeting on that and start, uh, writing, uh, right after the subtitler study is, is a way.
I'll try to record somewhat my suggestion about how to use the language ID in theirs that we have in the document, and otherwise, uh, uh, uh, uh, have a good week and talk to you, uh, next, uh, Thursday, and be in touch, uh, with, uh, the preparations for the for the events so that is, uh and the continuous evaluation.
